# Differences from React

Octane implements React's programming model — the same hooks, `memo`, context,
portals, Suspense, transitions, actions, and SSR/streaming APIs. Its core suite
contains 3,900+ distinct behavioral tests; production-compiler executions rerun
the normal cases and are not additional unique coverage. That is a local suite
count, not a count of tests ported from React. The exact pinned snapshot,
source-attributed React scenarios, classifications, and coverage are tracked in
the generated [React parity coverage report](./react-parity-coverage.md).

The differences below are **deliberate**; parity outside them is the goal.
Examples omit routine imports and types unless they affect the behavior being
shown.

## No rules of hooks (except plain JS loops)

Hooks may sit behind a condition or after an early return:

```tsx
// React: hook order cannot change after a conditional return.
// Octane: every hook call site owns its own stable slot.
function Editor({ editable, initialValue }) {
  if (!editable) return <ReadOnly />;

  const [draft, setDraft] = useState(initialValue);
  return (
    <input
      value={draft}
      onInput={(event) => setDraft(event.currentTarget.value)}
    />
  );
}
```

This is valid in Octane because the compiler assigns each hook call site a
stable slot; hooks are not identified by call order.

A hook that a render skips keeps its state. The early return in `Editor` only
skips the rest of that render, so `draft` survives while `editable` is false and
still holds the edited text when the input comes back. State belongs to the
component, `@for` row, or directive arm that calls the hook, and lasts as long as
that owner stays mounted, whether the call site sits behind an `if`, after an
early return, or in a custom hook that returns early. Effects follow the current
render instead: an effect that a completed render does not reach is cleaned up,
and it runs again when a later render reaches it.

A plain JavaScript loop is the exception:

```tsx
for (const item of items) {
  useState(false); // Compile error: every iteration would share one slot.
}

@for (const item of items; key item.id) {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false); // Separate state for each key.
  <Row item={item} open={open} onToggle={() => setOpen(!open)} />
}
```

Use a keyed `@for` template directive or extract a child component so every item
has its own render scope. `use()` and `useContext` are exempt from the loop
restriction because they are keyed by call order and context identity,
respectively.

## Compiler-inferred hook dependencies

Dependency arrays are optional for `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`,
`useInsertionEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useImperativeHandle`:

```tsx
import { save } from './api';

useEffect(() => save(order.id)); // Inferred: [order.id]
useEffect(() => save(order.id), [order]); // Exactly [order]
useEffect(() => save(order.id), []); // Exactly []; never rewritten
useEffect(() => save(order.id), null); // Run after every render

useEffect(makeEffect()); // Compile error: pass an array or null
```

Omitting the argument asks the compiler to derive it from the callback's lexical
captures. An explicit array is authoritative and keeps React's exact behavior;
`null` opts out of tracking. Opaque callback creation such as
`useEffect(makeEffect())` needs an explicit array or `null`, because evaluating
it again to discover dependencies would change program behavior.

### Direct built-in hook calls

Inference applies wherever Octane processes a supported built-in hook call,
including inside a custom hook authored in `.tsrx`, `.tsx`, or plain
`.ts`/`.js`. For example, a custom hook in plain TypeScript can omit both
dependency arrays:

```ts
import { useEffect, useMemo } from 'octane';

export function useLoggedValue(value: string, log: (value: string) => void) {
  const formatted = useMemo(() => value.toUpperCase());

  useEffect(() => {
    log(formatted);
  });

  return formatted;
}
```

The memo tracks `value`; the effect tracks `formatted` and `log`. The custom
hook's caller supplies no dependency array.

The analysis tracks one-level member paths and distinguishes values that can
change between renders:

| Capture | Inferred behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Other component-local values and module-scope `let`/`var` | Tracked |
| State setters, reducer dispatchers, refs, and state getters | Omitted as stable |
| `useEffectEvent` results | Omitted because Effect Events are non-reactive |
| Imports and unreassigned module-scope `const`/`function`/`class` | Omitted as program-lifetime identities |
| A local `const` naming one of those stable values, or a literal | Omitted |
| A local binding initialized after the hook call, such as a later `const` or `var`, or the `const` that receives the hook's own result. Also a local variable assigned after the call, or from a nested function | No list: `null` runs the hook on every render, as an omitted array does in React. Strong mode reports it instead |

A member read through a stable module binding, such as `CONFIG.mode`, is also
omitted. Mutating such an object in place is therefore not witnessed by a
dependency array; state that should drive rendering belongs in state, context,
or a store rather than a module singleton.

Member reads inside a conditional branch, after a possible early exit,
protected by exception handling, or skipped by an optional chain preserve that
protection. An optional chain skips the arguments and computed keys after its
optional link: `run?.(options.label)` and `value?.[options.key]` read
`options` only once the receiver exists. Compiler-memoized `use()` arguments,
including those in plain `.ts`/`.js` hook modules, and server-rendered prop
creations apply the same optional-chain rule to their dependencies. For
one-level reads,
the inferred array inspects an own property descriptor: a data property tracks
its value, while an accessor or inherited property tracks its receiver without
invoking a getter. An absent property tracks `undefined`. Failed reflection
probes track the receiver, leaving the
authored callback responsible for the read and its exception handling. Thus a
guarded `props.onChange(...)` still tracks a stable own arrow callback when the
props container changes, while method getters stay behind their authored guard.
Null and undefined receivers use separate module-local markers, so a failed receiver
read does not compare equal to a successful own-data read of null or undefined.
These markers are created once per module, rather than once per probe.
These guarded probes allocate a property descriptor; unguarded one-level
method calls read the property directly.

A one-level method call reads both the method and the receiver it passes as
`this`. The compiled array selects the value that can change between renders
on each render, based on the method:

- An own arrow function tracks itself: `props.onChange(...)` tracks
  `props.onChange` when it is an arrow, because an arrow cannot see the
  receiver it is called on.
- Any other method can read `this`, so it tracks its receiver, as React
  Compiler does for every method call. `count.toFixed(2)` tracks `count`,
  because `Number.prototype.toFixed` is one function for every number, and
  `source.read()` tracks `source` when `read` is an ordinary `function` or a
  method, even if several objects share that one function.
- An absent handler in an optional call tracks a stable `undefined`:
  `props.onReady?.()` does not re-run its hook until a handler is passed.

The arrow check reads the function's source text. Where an engine does not
expose source text, every own function tracks its receiver.

Deeper calls such as `cart.items.push(x)` track their receiver path
(`cart.items`), unchanged.

Some closures declare that their body runs in another context, not during
render. A directive from a known list marks them: `'use gpu'` (TypeGPU shader
code) and `'worklet'` (Reanimated UI-thread code). Inside such a closure, the
inferred array tracks only the root variables it captures and reads none of
their properties:

```tsx
const pipeline = useMemo(() =>
  root.createRenderPipeline({
    fragment: () => {
      'use gpu';
      return timeUniform.$; // legal only in shader code — never read at render
    },
  }),
); // Inferred: [root, timeUniform]
```

The list is deliberate. Same-context hints (`'use strict'`, React Compiler's
`'use memo'`/`'use no memo'`) and markers with their own semantics
(`'use server'`, `'use cache'`) do not truncate.

### Calls to custom wrappers

Inferring a missing dependency argument at a **call to a custom wrapper** is a
separate, narrower operation:

```tsx
function useTrackedEffect(effect, dependencies) {
  useEffect(effect, dependencies);
}

useTrackedEffect(() => save(order.id)); // Local transparent wrapper: inferred.
importedTrackedEffect(() => save(order.id), [order.id]); // Explicit array.
```

| Wrapper call | Dependency argument |
| --- | --- |
| Local transparent wrapper in `.tsrx`/`.tsx` | Inferred |
| Nested transparent wrappers in the same module | Inferred |
| Wrapper call in plain `.ts`/`.js` | Required explicitly |
| Imported or method-style wrapper | Required explicitly |
| Wrapper that inspects or transforms its callback/dependencies | Required explicitly |

A transparent wrapper forwards its callback and final dependency parameter to a
supported built-in hook. The compiler does not infer that contract from a
`use*` name alone. Plain `.ts`/`.js` compilation still infers direct built-in
hook calls inside a custom hook; it only declines to modify calls to wrappers.

### Dependency values as callback arguments

Octane passes a hook's dependency values as positional arguments to `useMemo`
factories and effect callbacks. This extension also applies to an explicitly
supplied dependency array; callbacks written for React usually ignore these
arguments. A callback with default parameters can observe the difference. Client
and server `useMemo` use the same convention.

## Automatic memoization and calls in templates

Production builds automatically memoize component regions. The default
compatibility mode is conservative about calls whose receivers can hide mutable
state:

```tsx
{formatPrice(cents)} // May memoize: formatPrice is imported.
{formatLabel(row)} // May memoize: same-module immutable projection.

{row.getValue()} // Re-runs: member call.
{format(row.get())} // Re-runs: an argument contains a member call.
{localFormat(row)} // Re-runs: component-local callee.
{use(resource)} // Re-runs: hook and suspension point.
```

A call keeps its surrounding region memoizable only when the callee is an
imported binding or an unreassigned same-module function whose body is itself a
value projection. Arguments must satisfy the same rule.

In compatibility mode, member calls fail closed because the receiver may be a live object:
`header.getIsSorted()` can return a new answer while `header` retains the same
identity. A module helper that merely wraps that method has the same hazard and
does not qualify. Component-local callees, hooks (including `unstable_use*`),
`new Foo()`, and tagged templates also keep their region unmemoized. This
changes only the optimization—the region safely re-runs.

A direct render-time read of a mutable module binding (`let`, `var`, or a
reassigned function) or of a host or application global such as `location`,
`window`, or `globalThis.flag` keeps its region live. That includes keyed
`@for` rows, which otherwise skip unchanged survivors. Module `const`s,
unreassigned functions, and standard language globals such as `Math` and
`JSON` do not. A region *is* allowed to memoize past module state returned by
an imported helper; module state that must drive rendering belongs in state or
context. Octane cannot read across a module boundary, so an imported helper is
taken at its word — that is the one place this analysis trusts rather than
proves, and it matches React Compiler's own assumption.

This preserves ordinary React rendering for live receivers; it is not a promise
to reproduce every React Compiler optimization. React Compiler also identifies
APIs with interior mutability, including TanStack Table v8, as
[incompatible with memoization](https://react.dev/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/incompatible-library).
Stable function or object identity alone does not prove a result is unchanged.
React Compiler lint classifications and option-sensitive output are useful
comparison evidence, not Octane configuration: changing JSX outlining, adding a
debug hook, or using React's `"use memo"` directives does not alter Octane's
compatibility/Strong boundary.

### Strong mode and render calls

A module that opts into [`"use strong"`](#optional-strong-mode) asserts a stricter
contract: rendering is a referentially transparent projection of props, state,
context, and immutable snapshots. Every user-authored call evaluated for render
output must return the same value for the same witnessed inputs and must not
perform application-visible work. That assertion covers local and imported
functions, static and computed methods, call-produced callees, constructors,
tagged templates, and synchronously invoked callbacks.

Production client builds can therefore condition eligible regions on their
witnessed inputs without using `use*` spelling as a purity oracle. An ordinary
function named `useFormat` is no less memoizable than `format`; Strong does not
reintroduce React's Rules of Hooks through a naming heuristic. Actual hooks keep
their compiler-owned setup semantics. The compiler recognizes built-in hooks by
import provenance, including optional calls, and resolves same-module
custom-hook declarations and function-valued module bindings by lexical binding.
Transitive and cyclic paths reach a fixed point, while reassigned module bindings
stay on the conservative setup path. Their context subscriptions, state cells,
suspension points, and effect lifecycles remain outside ordinary projection
caches.

An eligible expression that the template evaluates on every render (a host
child hole, a host attribute, or a component prop) gets the same cache as that
expression named by a `const` in setup. `<output>{total.toFixed(2)}</output>`
recomputes only when `total` changes, as it does under React Compiler.
Expressions in `@if`, `@for`, `@switch`, and `@try` arms, component children,
and built-in boundaries still evaluate only when they render. Expressions that
contain JSX, event handlers, refs, and keys keep their own lowering. A
component that returns JSX gets the cache only after an authored hook call, so
a hookless one remains an ordinary function.

For an eligible operation, the cache guard witnesses the callable and its
receiver as well as explicit arguments. A derived receiver such as
`factory().read(input)` is represented by the factory, its receiver, and its
arguments rather than by a transient returned-object identity. Witnesses use
`Object.is` equality at component and ordinary-list projection boundaries, so
repeated `NaN` is stable while `0` and `-0` invalidate separately. A certified
keyed-selection operand retains the authored strict-equality semantics while
other list captures still use `Object.is`. Hiding hook state, a state getter,
`ref.current`, a clock or random
value, mutable module state, or an external live store behind a render call
violates the assertion because the result can change without a witnessed input
changing.

Compiler diagnostics catch a useful subset of violations, but they are not a
whole-program proof and unknown call shapes do not fall back to compatibility
behavior. Calling imported code from a Strong module asserts that the particular
render use is snapshot-safe; it does not make the library's live objects
immutable. Keep a consumer of live accessors in compatibility mode, or read an
actual reactive snapshot and pass it into a separate Strong component.

Compatibility keeps a member call live only while the render scope containing
that call actually executes. It does not create a subscription and cannot make a
stable live object safe across `memo`, an unchanged child boundary, or Strong
memoization. The supported migration is to subscribe and select in compatibility
code, then cross the Strong boundary with the selected value:

```tsx
// SelectionBridge.tsrx — compatibility mode
function SelectionBridge({ table, row }) @{
  <table.Subscribe
    source={table.atoms.rowSelection}
    selector={(selection) => !!selection[row.id]}
  >
    {(selected) => <StrongSelectionRow label={row.original.name} selected={selected} />}
  </table.Subscribe>
}
```

```tsx
// StrongSelectionRow.tsrx
"use strong";

function StrongSelectionRow({ label, selected }) @{
  <li data-selected={selected ? '1' : '0'}>{label}</li>
}
```

Passing only `row`, shallow-copying an object that still contains its live
methods, or forcing an unrelated render without selecting `selected` does not
create a snapshot witness.

### Keyed rows and logging

A key preserves a surviving row's DOM identity; it does not promise that its
JavaScript body runs only once. In Strong production builds, diagnostic calls
such as `console.log('row', item.id)` do not disqualify an otherwise eligible
row from reuse. Do not rely on logging, metrics, mutation, allocation, or any
other render-time call count: evaluation can differ in production, development,
HMR, profiling, server rendering, hydration, retries, and aborted work.

A changed captured value still invalidates a row, including captures inside its
event handlers:

```tsx
onClick={() => setItems(items.filter((entry) => entry.id !== item.id))}
```

Appending changes `items`, so surviving rows must receive a handler for the new
snapshot. Skipping that update could make removing an original row also discard
the appended item. If removal should use the latest state, a functional update
does not capture the parent array:

```tsx
onClick={() => setItems((current) => current.filter((entry) => entry.id !== item.id))}
```

The first form remains correct and supported. Strong mode does not change its
closure semantics or promise to skip its reevaluation.

### Local mutation and retained rows

Mutation of fresh render-local data is supported when it finishes before that
data escapes. A plain JavaScript loop has normal sequential JavaScript semantics:

```tsx
function Labels({ items }) @{
  const labels = [];
  for (const item of items) labels.push(item.label);
  <p>{labels.join(', ')}</p>
}
```

A keyed `@for` body is different: every surviving key owns a retained render
scope that may be evaluated independently. Writing a binding declared outside
the row would make its output depend on which other rows happened to run and in
what order. Strong reports that shape as
`OCTANE_STRONG_RETAINED_ROW_MUTATION`:

```tsx
let position = 0;
@for (const item of items; key item.id) {
  position++; // Strong compile error: shared across retained rows.
  <li>{String(position)}</li>
}
```

Use setup to build a complete value before it escapes, keep mutable scratch data
inside one row, or use the directive's index binding when position is the desired
input:

```tsx
@for (const item of items; index position; key item.id) {
  <li>{String(position + 1)}</li>
}
```

Compatibility mode accepts a cross-row write but does not promise a retained
row evaluation order, so it must not determine rendered output there either.

## Derived values are cached at their declaration

```tsx
const labels = formatRows(rows); // Cached on [rows]: imported projection.
const items = virtualizer.getVirtualItems(); // Not cached: member call.
const visible = todos.filter((todo) => !todo.completed); // Cached only for proven state snapshots.
let freshLabels = formatRows(rows); // Not cached: `let` is an escape hatch.
```

An eligible `const` keeps the same identity until its tracked component-local
inputs change. This lets a region key on the identity of a derived value instead
of seeing a new array or object on every render. Caching follows a chain: in
`const labels = formatRows(rows); const view = wrapRows(labels);` with only
`view` in the template, `labels` is cached too, so `view` is rebuilt only when
`rows` changes.

The same callee rule governs declaration caching. In compatibility mode, the virtualizer call must stay
live because its window can move while the virtualizer object keeps the same
identity. Most member calls, including arbitrary `items.filter(...)` calls,
therefore remain uncached.

The production `.tsrx` compiler admits one narrow exception: a native `filter`
projection over a state value created by a genuine `useState([])` call when every
setter use remains private and produces a fresh, provably ordinary array
snapshot. The predicate must only inspect an own data property, and a runtime
guard verifies the array's dense entries, item properties, native methods,
constructor, and species before reusing an unchanged snapshot. Unknown aliases,
mutable receivers, getters, proxies, sparse arrays, overridden methods, custom
species, and unproven predicates retain the existing live path. Use an explicit
`useMemo` when an otherwise unsupported identity needs caching.

Within the same proven component, a single-token class object driven by primitive
state can reuse its existing per-binding change guard. Controlled `value` and
`checked` bindings still reassert their values on every commit.

Also never cached in compatibility mode:

- **Hook-shaped calls.** `const s = useThing()` and
  `const s = unstable_useThing()` conservatively keep their setup live. Strong
  instead recognizes actual built-in hooks by import provenance and same-module
  function or function-valued custom-hook setup by lexical call-graph analysis;
  an unrelated `useFormat()` remains an ordinary pure-call assertion.
- **Values the render tree never reads.** A calculation used only by an event
  handler pays nothing.

Within those bounds the contract is pure render: the cached value is reused while
its tracked inputs are unchanged, so a projection that reads state no input
witnesses keeps its old value. Pass such state through
`useState`/`useReducer`/context and it is witnessed normally.

## `useState` / `useReducer` current-state getters

Both state hooks have an Octane-only third tuple member: a stable `getState`
function that reads the latest scheduled state.

```tsx
const [draft, setDraft, getDraft] = useState('');
const [total, dispatch, getTotal] = useReducer(reducer, 0);

async function saveLater() {
  await readyToSave();
  save(getDraft()); // Latest scheduled state, not this render's stale value.
}

function add(amount) {
  dispatch(amount);
  console.log(getTotal()); // Latest scheduled reducer state.
}
```

`getState` is the conventional generic name for this stable zero-argument
getter; the example uses domain-specific names instead. It replaces the common
React pattern of synchronizing a ref solely for delayed or async callbacks.

The getter reads the latest scheduled hook-cell value and does not subscribe or
render. During pending work it can therefore be newer than the currently
committed DOM. The compiler emits a getter-enabled hook only when tuple index 2
can be observed, preserving the existing runtime path and allocation profile for
ordinary two-item destructuring. Escaped or ambiguous tuples conservatively
receive the complete three-item shape.

## Linked state updates without a render-time setter

React sometimes keeps local state in sync with a changing prop by calling a
setter during render:

```tsx
const [previousUserId, setPreviousUserId] = useState(user.id);
const [name, setName] = useState(user.name);

if (previousUserId !== user.id) {
  setPreviousUserId(user.id);
  setName(user.name);
}
```

Octane's `useLinkedState` expresses the same intent directly:

```tsx
const [name, setName] = useLinkedState(user.id, () => user.name);
```

The value remains editable with `setName`. When `user.id` changes, the hook
returns the new name immediately, without an effect, a user setter during
render, or a second render attempt. The calculation receives the previous
`{ source, value }` when a source changes, or `undefined` on the first render,
so it can preserve useful parts of the old value. `sourceEqual` and `valueEqual`
default to `Object.is`; pass custom comparators as an optional third argument.
The tuple also supports the same optional latest-value getter as `useState`.

## Optional Strong mode

Strong modules also require inferred dependencies, compiler-owned memoization,
keyed template lists in `.tsrx`, and branded HTML values. Standard keyed JSX
mapping remains supported in `.tsx`. See the
[Strong compiler checks and migration table](./strong-compiler-checks.md), and the
[Strong mode guide](https://octanejs.dev/docs/strong-mode) for adopting it in an
existing app.

Strong mode opts into the immutable render-snapshot contract above and adds
compile-time checks for detectable violations. Opt into one module with a
directive before its imports:

```tsx
"use strong";

import { useLinkedState } from 'octane';
```

Alternatively, enable it across application-owned modules with
`compiler: { strong: true }` in `octane.config.ts`. Installed dependencies stay
in compatibility mode unless their own source opts in.

A Strong module cannot call a state updater during render or synchronously while
setting up an effect, and it cannot read or assign to a `useRef` object's
`current` during render (`OCTANE_STRONG_RENDER_REF_READ` for reads,
`OCTANE_STRONG_RENDER_REF_WRITE` for writes). React's lazy initialization,
`if (ref.current === null) ref.current = create()`, does both: create the value
once with `useLazyRef(() => create())` instead. A layout effect that copies a DOM
measurement into state is a synchronous update in effect setup
(`OCTANE_STRONG_EFFECT_STATE_UPDATE`): render the measurement from
`useLayoutSnapshot(measure, { initial })` instead. It also
rejects calling a known third-tuple state getter during render
(`OCTANE_STRONG_RENDER_STATE_GETTER_CALL`): the getter can observe scheduled
state that differs from the render snapshot. Read the state tuple's first member
when rendering; call the getter in events, effects, or deferred work. Reading a
reassigned module-scope `let` or `var` during render is also an error
(`OCTANE_STRONG_RENDER_MODULE_STATE_READ`): move changing values into state or
context, or pass an immutable snapshot as a prop. The checks follow provable
synchronous calls through local callbacks and `useEffectEvent`. Calling a statically
known Effect Event during render or including it in an explicit hook dependency
list is also a compile error. Strong modules use normal const declarations for
automatic memoization. Manual memo hooks and non-equivalent explicit dependencies
are errors; equivalent arrays keep their behavior and produce a hint.

Inside an async function, code after a guaranteed `await` is not synchronous. In
effect work, an `await` that resumes without waiting, such as `await null`, does
not count. A `catch` clause is synchronous only when its `try` block can throw,
or can await a settled rejection, before its first guaranteed `await`. A
`finally` clause, or code after the `try` statement, is synchronous only when
the `try` or `catch` can finish before one. Calls, `new`, `throw`, and iteration
can throw; property reads and operators do not count. The awaited call itself,
and any call it chains from through `then`, `catch`, or `finally`, is trusted to
report failure by rejecting. So is each call written as an element of an array
literal passed to an awaited `Promise.all`, `Promise.allSettled`, `Promise.any`,
or `Promise.race`, unless the module declares its own `Promise`. The callees and
arguments of trusted calls still evaluate first. So in `try { const data = await
Promise.all([api.a(id), api.b(id)]); if (!ignore) setData(data); } catch (error)
{ if (!ignore) setError(error); }` the `catch` runs after a yield, while `await
api.get(toKey(id))` or `await Promise.all(ids.map(load))` leaves it synchronous.
An update after a yield in an effect still needs cleanup that cancels or ignores
it (`OCTANE_STRONG_EFFECT_DATA_FETCH`).

The compiler also rejects render-time writes through a provable state snapshot
(`OCTANE_STRONG_RENDER_SNAPSHOT_MUTATION`) and direct calls to known
non-idempotent globals such as `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, and
`crypto.randomUUID()` (`OCTANE_STRONG_RENDER_IMPURE_CALL`), including inside
callbacks that known array methods run synchronously. These checks follow
supported aliases and synchronous helpers; they do not prove arbitrary method
bodies or imported code pure. Lazy state and `useLazyRef` initialization may
obtain an initial timestamp or random value. Locale- and time-zone-dependent formatting of a
provable `Date` or an `Intl` service during render reports
`OCTANE_STRONG_RENDER_LOCALE_FORMAT`; pass an explicit locale and `timeZone`.
Scheduling work during render with `setTimeout`, `setInterval`,
`queueMicrotask`, `requestAnimationFrame`, or `requestIdleCallback` reports
`OCTANE_STRONG_RENDER_SIDE_EFFECT`, including in a lazy initializer; schedule
from an event handler or an effect.
State values stay immutable outside render too
(`OCTANE_STRONG_SNAPSHOT_MUTATION`), updaters and reducers follow the render
checks because Octane may replay them (`OCTANE_STRONG_IMPURE_UPDATER`), and a
deferred update may not compute from its own render snapshot
(`OCTANE_STRONG_STALE_STATE_UPDATE`). See the
[Strong compiler check reference](./strong-compiler-checks.md#state-values-updaters-and-subscriptions).

Reading unshadowed `window`, `document`, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`,
`navigator`, `location`, or `matchMedia` during render reports
`OCTANE_STRONG_RENDER_AMBIENT_READ`. This includes `typeof` guards and constant
aliases of those browser handles. Reading a `globalThis` property also reports
the error, including computed properties whose names are unknown, except for
known standard language builtins such as `globalThis.JSON`. Reading the
`globalThis` object itself remains supported.
Shadowed local names and scalar snapshots captured at module initialization are
not browser-handle reads. The analysis does not generally prove aliases obtained
through defaults, returned values, containers, arbitrary deeper properties, or
imports. Those values still have to satisfy the render-snapshot contract.

For changing browser state, use `useSyncExternalStore` with a server snapshot
and render its returned snapshot. Browser reads in its snapshot callbacks,
events, effects, and deferred callbacks remain supported. Lazy `useState`,
`useReducer`, and `useLazyRef` initializers may also read browser state for an
initial value. They
still run during server rendering: guard unavailable browser APIs and ensure the
server and client agree on initial output. A `typeof window` guard inside an
ordinary render calculation does not make the calculation snapshot-safe.

Strong modules also keep the DOM that Octane renders under the template's
control. A ref write to children, a class, an attribute, or a `style` property
that the template sets on the same element reports
`OCTANE_STRONG_MANAGED_DOM_WRITE`, and raw HTML written to a rendered element
reports `OCTANE_STRONG_RAW_HTML_WRITE`. A document query for a literal `id` or
class the same component renders reports `OCTANE_STRONG_OWN_MARKUP_QUERY`. React
accepts all three.

The directive is also an author assertion for production memoization, not just a
request for diagnostics. Render output must not observe changing data through a
stable ref, state getter, module variable, external store object, or hidden hook.
All user-authored render calls and synchronously invoked callbacks must be pure
for their witnessed inputs. Function names—including `use*` names—do not change
that contract or disable the optimization.

Strong mode also checks where compiler-managed work belongs. A locally
declared built-in hook value used only inside one nested `@{…}` block belongs
beside that block's JSX, as does an effect observing only its local values. An
outer declaration reports `OCTANE_STRONG_HOOK_LOCALITY` and names the block and
source line, including any local helpers that must move with the value. Hooks
and effects used only in an `@if`, keyed `@for`, `@switch`, or `@try` arm can
remain in the parent scope, preserving their parent lifetime. A hook shared by
sibling template blocks stays in their common scope. Moving a hook into a
nested `@{…}` block gives it that block's lifetime, even when the previous
block contained only JSX and served as transparent grouping.

A local callback used by a native `onX` event can be inline or declared beside
its JSX, including `<button {onClick} />`. A named callback declared outside
the sole deeper nested `@{…}` block containing its direct event use reports
`OCTANE_STRONG_EVENT_HANDLER_LOCALITY`; a callback declared in the same scope
as the JSX is valid. Shared, imported, and forwarded callbacks remain
supported. Locality diagnostics use authored source locations and preserve
declaration positions in client, server, and editor compilation. Strong also
adds eligible hook-input caches in development and production, so opting in can
change generated code. The [eligibility rules](./strong-compiler-checks.md)
describe which declarations keep a stable identity. Setting
`compiler: { strong: true }` applies these checks and caches across
application-owned modules; installed dependencies opt in separately.

Event handlers, genuinely deferred callbacks, effect cleanup, effects that
synchronize an external system, and normal DOM or timer refs remain supported.
Replace prop-driven state resets with `useLinkedState` instead of calling a
setter during render.

## JSX values follow the represented render scope

Moving compiler-authored JSX into a variable, prop, array, or other value
position does not move its represented context provider, Suspense boundary, or
error boundary:

```tsx
const Theme = createContext('outer');
const theme = {
  get current() {
    return use(Theme);
  },
};

function Page() {
  const content = (
    <Theme value="inner">
      <span data-theme={theme.current}>{theme.current}</span>
    </Theme>
  );

  return <main>{content}</main>; // data-theme="inner" and text "inner".
}
```

When Octane renders that stored subtree, the entire compiler-authored element
record, including a dynamic root type, its props, and descendant expressions,
resolves after its represented provider or boundary has entered its scope. This
includes implicit user code in getters, Proxy traps, coercion hooks, iterators,
and computed keys, not only explicit function calls. React evaluates JSX
expressions while constructing the caller's element, before that element's
represented provider or boundary renders; Octane intentionally follows the
visible rendered tree instead.

The same applies to JSX a function returns when you call it directly, whether
the function is an arrow, a method, or a named `function` declaration:

```tsx
function Label() {
  return <span>{use(Theme)}</span>;
}

function Page() {
  const label = Label();
  return <Theme value="inner">{label}</Theme>; // "inner"
}
```

Statements before the `return` still run during the call; only the returned
element record waits for its render scope. Rendering the function as a
component, `<Label />`, evaluates its output as part of that component's own
render.

JSX values remain inspectable element descriptors: `isValidElement`,
`Children.only`, `cloneElement`, and ordinary `type`/`props`/`children`
inspection keep their existing contracts. Inspecting a deferred element record
as data resolves it in the inspecting caller's current scope; it does not enter
a provider or boundary that has not rendered. Static JSX, explicit
`createElement(...)` calls, and event or render-prop callbacks retain ordinary
JavaScript evaluation semantics.

### Values that exist only during the building call

Deferral applies to every compiler-authored JSX value, including host-only
markup with no provider or boundary of its own. When a method or arrow function
returns JSX, or JSX is stored in a variable, array, or prop, its non-literal
props and children can run after the building call has returned. They run when
Octane renders or inspects the element, in the scope of the component rendering
it. Anything valid only while that call is on the stack is gone by then, such
as a module-level "current" value read through a function, an open
transaction, or a library read context. A variable the JSX reads directly keeps
its value from the building call; see
[Variables reassigned after the JSX evaluates](#variables-reassigned-after-the-jsx-evaluates).

Lexical calls `DecoratorNode.decorate()` while it reconciles an update, with
that update's editor state active, and expects the returned element to be
complete. Node methods that read editor state, such as `$getState(...)` or
`getLatest()`, throw when no editor state is active:

```tsx
class LabelNode extends DecoratorNode {
  getLabel() {
    return $getState(this, labelState);
  }

  decorate() {
    // React calls getLabel() here, while editor state is active. Octane calls
    // it when the decorator renders, after decorate() has returned, so
    // $getState throws.
    return <span>{this.getLabel()}</span>;
  }
}
```

Read context-bound values into locals before building the JSX, so the element
carries plain data:

```tsx
decorate() {
  const label = this.getLabel();
  return <span>{label}</span>;
}
```

`createElement('span', null, this.getLabel())` also evaluates its arguments
during the call. To read the state at render time instead, pass a stable input
such as the node key to a component, and have that component open its own read,
for example with `editor.read(...)`.

### Variables reassigned after the JSX evaluates

Deferral does not change which value a variable contributes. When deferred JSX
reads a local, parameter, or module variable directly, and code can assign that
variable again after the JSX evaluates, the compiler captures the value as the
JSX evaluates, as React does:

```tsx
function List() {
  let n = -1;
  return (
    <ul>
      {['a', 'b', 'c'].map((x) => {
        n++;
        // Renders 0, 1, 2, not 2 three times.
        return <li key={x}><Row index={n} />{String(n)}</li>;
      })}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

The same applies to a counter or parameter that a loop changes, a `var`
initialized on each iteration, and a variable assigned an element that wraps
its previous value, such as `content = <Frame>{content}</Frame>`. Functions
inside the JSX, such as event handlers, still see the variable's current value
when they run, as in React. A variable that nothing can assign after the JSX
evaluates is read directly and costs nothing extra.

Three cases still read at render:

- An expression that assigns, such as `{String(n++)}`, runs its assignment at
  render, so its reads of `n` also happen then.
- Only variables are captured. A property, getter, or call result, such as
  `{counter.value}` or `{getLabel()}`, is read when the element renders. Copy it
  into a `const` before building the JSX to keep the earlier value.
- A module-level `function` declaration that returns JSX builds its element
  when it renders. Calling it directly (`const label = Label()` instead of
  `<Label />`) therefore reads the variables it uses when that element renders.
  Arrow functions, function expressions, and methods capture them during the
  call.

### Template children and inspection

Children authored inside an `@{ ... }` template normally arrive at a component
as a compiled render body. Rendering `{children}` works, but that body is not an
element descriptor: `Children.count`, `Children.map`, `Children.toArray`,
`Children.only`, and `cloneElement` cannot inspect its contents. JSX returned
from an ordinary function and explicit `createElement` values remain inspectable.

Mark components that inspect or clone their children with the public
`descriptorChildren` compiler marker:

```tsx
import { Children, cloneElement, descriptorChildren } from 'octane';

const Slot = descriptorChildren(function Slot({ children }) {
  return cloneElement(Children.only(children), { 'data-slot': true });
});

function Example() @{
  <Slot><button>Save</button></Slot>
}
```

The marker leaves the component's runtime identity unchanged and requests
descriptor children at compiled call sites. The bundler follows marked exports
through imports; a standalone compiler caller can mark a local binding explicitly.
For a function-as-child API that also accepts ordinary template children, use
`typeof children === 'function' && !isChildrenBlock(children)` before invoking a
render prop. A compiled children body must be rendered through Octane.

### Template branch identity

Each `@if`/`@else`, `@switch` arm, and template-lowered conditional arm owns a
separate render scope. Switching arms remounts their contents even when both
arms contain the same component or host tag. Uncontrolled values and child
state therefore reset. To preserve identity, keep one component outside the
branch and make its props conditional, such as `<Row value={active ? a : b} />`.
Ordinary returned element descriptors follow their type and key identity instead.

### Raw script and scoped style bodies

In `.tsrx`, the body of `<script>` is JavaScript source and the body of
`<style>` is scoped CSS source. They are not JSX expression containers.
`<script>{JSON.stringify(data)}</script>` therefore writes those literal source
characters, and `<style>{css}</style>` is not valid scoped CSS syntax.
Use a prop for dynamic content:

```tsx
<script type="application/ld+json" children={JSON.stringify(data)} />
<style children={css} />
<style dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: css }} />
```

A style element with explicit content props is an ordinary host element. A
literal CSS body retains Octane's scoped-style compilation. These forms also
work through `createElement` for runtime-created content.

## Native event objects, no synthetic event layer

The public type names follow that contract too. `MouseEvent<T>`,
`MouseEventHandler<T>`, `InputEvent<T>`, and the other event families describe
native DOM events with a typed `currentTarget`; they have no `nativeEvent`,
`persist`, or synthetic propagation methods. `HTMLAttributes`, the specialized
host attribute types, `CSSProperties`, `Ref`, `FC`, and `ComponentProps` can be
imported from `octane`. `ReactNode` and `ReactElement` are migration aliases for
Octane values; prefer `OctaneNode` and `ElementDescriptor` in new code. These
aliases do not make Octane elements renderable by a React root.

Delegated capture and bubbling are scoped to each root's portion of the event
path. Native listeners between nested roots run before the next root's handlers,
and can prevent the event from reaching that root. Shadow roots and distributed
slots use the browser's composed path without replacing its retargeted `target`
or `relatedTarget`. Portals still propagate through their logical ancestors.
A portal rendered into a closed shadow root physically inside its own outer
root is a known interop limit: the outer listener cannot see the hidden portal
boundary, so shared outer ancestors can receive both deliveries. React also
exhibits duplicate delivery in this topology.
Native non-bubbling families (`toggle`, dialog `close`/`cancel`, media,
`load`/`error`) emulate logical bubbling from a root capture listener; their
interleaving with direct native listeners is not identical to React's event
plugins.

Within a delegated phase, propagation cancellation follows React's separation
between its framework queue and native dispatch, while keeping a native event:

- `event.stopPropagation()` in an Octane handler stops the remaining handlers
  in that logical phase and calls the browser's native method.
- An earlier external listener on the same root calling native
  `stopPropagation()` does not truncate Octane's handler queue. An external
  listener below the root can still prevent that queue from receiving the event.
- `event.stopImmediatePropagation()` stops later native listeners on the same
  node, but does not truncate the logical phase already running. This corresponds
  to React's `event.nativeEvent.stopImmediatePropagation()`. Call both stop
  methods to stop both queues. Neither method cancels the default action; use
  `preventDefault()` for that.

The native `cancelBubble` flag remains visible; it is not cleared to continue a
logical queue. Calling a native prototype method directly or setting that flag
operates on native propagation, not the separate framework queue. An immutable,
non-configurable own stop method also remains native-only: Octane does not
replace it or change the identity of the event.

What differs is the event API and synthesis layer:

```tsx
<button
  onClick={(event) => {
    console.log(event instanceof MouseEvent); // true
  }}
/>
```

- Handlers receive the browser's real `Event` object, not a React
  `SyntheticEvent` wrapper. There is no event pooling, and
  `event.currentTarget` is the handler's element.
- `mouseenter`/`pointerenter` families are the real per-element native events —
  no synthesis from `over`/`out`.
- `onFocus`/`onBlur` use the browser's bubbling `focusin`/`focusout` events,
  including capture variants; the event object retains that native type.
- Removing a focused host can make the browser dispatch `focusout` while the
  removal is in progress, and so can a deletion cleanup that moves focus. Every
  host the deletion removes starts no handler for it, including hosts of child
  components the teardown has not reached yet, but still-mounted ancestors
  receive it. React suppresses every event during its commit, including those
  ancestors' handlers.
- There are no synthetic `onChange`/`onBeforeInput`/`onSelect` polyfills — use
  the native events (`onInput` etc.).
- Root listeners are non-passive. `preventDefault()` in `onWheel` or
  `onTouchMove` can cancel scrolling when the native event is cancelable.
- Native `keypress` events are delivered even when their `charCode` is zero;
  Octane does not apply React's printable-character filter.
- Non-bubbling event families are available on any host, rather than only
  React's selected host types. A spread that introduces a previously unseen
  event installs its delegated listener lazily, after native container listeners
  that were registered earlier.

A noop `onclick` is stamped on delegation roots for iOS Safari, not on every
element.

## Controlled components, native events

Controlled `value`/`checked` on `<input>`/`<textarea>`/`<select>` match React
(2026-07-08): the prop drives the DOM property and reasserts on every commit
and after discrete events (rejected edits snap back), IME composition is
respected, radio groups restore as a group, `<select value>` projects options
(single + multiple), and `defaultValue`/`defaultChecked` are the uncontrolled
escape hatch. Hydration adopts pre-hydration user input, then the first
commit/discrete event reasserts. As in React 19, a value or checked state the
client renders differently from the server becomes the control's reset baseline
(the `value` attribute, a textarea's content, the `checked` attribute). An
unedited input or textarea follows it, and a checkbox or radio keeps its live
state. React 19 replaces a pre-hydration textarea edit with the client's content
even when server and client agree; Octane keeps the edit, as it does in an
input. `<textarea>` with children AND a
`value`/`defaultValue` prop is a compile error (the prop owns the content).

Uncontrolled `defaultValue` updates change an input or textarea's reset baseline
without replacing its live value. A select uses `defaultValue` on mount and
when `multiple` changes. A textarea's children, whether authored as JSX, held
by a spread, or passed as `children=`, are instead a live text binding; use
`defaultValue` when later renders must preserve user edits.
Removing a controlled textarea's `value` retains its current content.

A textarea's children are text on the client and the server. React accepts at
most one child and converts it with `'' + children`, so an element becomes
`[object Object]` and `false` becomes `"false"`. Octane joins any number of
children into one text value. Holes follow their usual text rules: `{x}` renders
strings and numbers, renders `null`, `undefined` and booleans as nothing, and
joins arrays or iterables of text; `{x as string}` stringifies like any text
binding. An element, function or other object throws on both sides, and an
element, component or template directive written inside a `<textarea>` is a
compile error. The HTML parser keeps textarea content as literal text, so it
can carry no hydration markers. A compiled textarea's holes may each hold a
signal handle; a textarea made by `createElement` or stored JSX takes text
children only.

A function form action has no `action` attribute while intercepted. Octane does
not serialize React's JavaScript-URL sentinel. `onSubmit` and ancestor handlers
run before the action and may cancel it with `preventDefault()`.

What differs is the **event layer**: there is no synthetic `onChange`.
`onInput` is the per-keystroke handler for text controls (the native `change`
event fires when the browser commits the edit, usually on blur);
checkboxes/radios/selects retain their normal native `change` behavior. Migration
of React-style text editing is a rename:

```jsx
<input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} /> // React
<input value={text} onInput={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} /> // Octane
```

`OCTANE_NATIVE_TEXT_ONCHANGE` warns when a statically known text-entry host has
`onChange`/`onChangeCapture` but no usable input handler. It covers `<textarea>`
and `<input>` with a missing or invalid type, or a `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`,
`password`, `email`, or `number` type. A development fallback handles unresolved
spreads, dynamic host/type values, and de-optimized `createElement` calls. It is
nonfatal and never changes which event runs. Selects, checkboxes, radios, file
inputs, custom elements, and component callbacks named `onChange` are not
warned. Capture handlers receive the corresponding `onInputCapture` guidance.

Native commit behavior is sometimes exactly the intent. Use an uncontrolled
value and the explicit JS-only suppression in that case:

```jsx
<input
  defaultValue={savedDraft}
  onChange={(event) => save(event.currentTarget.value)}
  suppressNativeChangeWarning
/>
```

`suppressNativeChangeWarning` only suppresses this diagnostic. It does not
serialize to HTML, rename an event, add a listener, or alter controlled-state
restoration. Do not add a noop `onInput` merely to silence the warning.

Checkbox/radio activation follows the platform's `click` → `input` →
non-cancelable `change` sequence. `preventDefault()` in native `onChange`
therefore cannot roll the toggle back:

```jsx
<input type="checkbox" onClick={(event) => event.preventDefault()} />
```

Cancel in `onClick` when rollback is intended. React's synthetic checkable
`onChange` is click-backed and can cancel activation at that callback, an
intentional event-layer divergence. Octane still lets native input/change
handlers observe the prospective checked state before restoring rejected
controlled state and radio cousins.

Form **actions**
(`<form action={fn}>`, `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`, `useOptimistic`,
`requestFormReset`, auto-reset) follow React 19's commit pattern. Action results
render at transition priority in a later host task (see the scheduler section
below), so a backlog of queued dispatches that settle together commits once, with
the final state, and intermediate results never commit. A hundred synchronous
`useActionState` dispatches commit twice, `isPending` and then the result, as in
React. Two differences remain: an action error does **not** cancel queued
dispatches (octane keeps threading), and every dispatch, even of a synchronous
action, starts its action one microtask after the call, where React runs the
first queued action synchronously.

## Attributes: native names, React's value rules

Attribute **values** follow React (matched 2026-07-08):

```tsx
<div hidden={1} /> // hidden=""
<div hidden={0} /> // attribute omitted
<div title={true} /> // omitted with a development warning
<div spellcheck={false} /> // spellcheck="false"
```

This includes boolean and overloaded-boolean normalization, property writes for
`muted`/`multiple`/`selected`, commit-phase `autoFocus`, `aria-*` stringification,
empty `src`/`href` removal (except `<a>`), function/symbol removal,
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` validation, and canonical camelCase aliases such as
`strokeWidth`, `xlinkHref`, `className`, and `htmlFor`.

What still differs: attribute **names** pass through natively — native
spellings are the idiom and simply work:

```tsx
<form accept-charset="utf-8" />
```

Diagnostic coverage is expanding progressively from the latest upstream
behavior without shipping React's complete `possibleStandardNames` table as
runtime data. Today, a curated slice of genuinely-broken casings warns in
development (`autofocus` → `autoFocus`, `defaultvalue` → `defaultValue`,
`defaultchecked` → `defaultChecked`, lowercase `on*` function props →
camelCase).

Other current differences:

- Odd objects coerce leniently via `toString()` (with a development
  `[object Object]` warning) instead of throwing.
- Octane retains `<area href="">` as a current-document hyperlink; React strips
  it.
- The browser parser canonicalizes a statically authored lowercase SVG
  `textlength` instead of following React's imperative warning path.
- `style` accepts a CSS string as well as an object, including `!important` and
  kebab-case property names. Object updates own only their authored properties;
  a string owns the complete inline declaration. Numeric object values receive
  units from the shared property table; `scale` is unitless and `cssFloat`
  aliases `float`.
- Child boundaries can leave empty comment anchors inside an `option`; its
  visible text and selected value are the supported observations.

## Development diagnostics and production errors

Octane progressively ports applicable development warnings and errors from the
latest upstream React/ReactDOM source. For a diagnostic classified as exact
parity, its tests cover observable details such as the trigger, console channel or
thrown constructor, message variants, dedupe lifetime, recovery, and
component/source context. Current coverage is intentionally partial: the
[latest-main diagnostic inventory](./react-diagnostics-plan.md#latest-main-diagnostic-inventory)
records implemented, pending, adapted, divergent, and unsupported families.
Diagnostics are adapted when an intentional Octane difference changes the useful
guidance; React-only APIs remain outside the supported surface.

An unknown event prop on an ordinary host can name a real native event instead
of being discarded. Template `@for` accepts iterable inputs, including maps and
generators, and supports inferred keys; React's missing-key and unsupported
iterator warnings do not describe those directives. Symbol renderables are
stringified as text. Error messages use Octane's vocabulary, and caught-error
logging and owner-stack context do not promise React's console transcript.

Development builds retain complete messages. Framework-authored errors in the
core DOM client and server runtimes that must still throw in production use an
[Octane-owned error-code catalog](../packages/octane/error-codes/README.md) and
compact links to `https://octanejs.dev/errors/<code>`. Octane's numbers are
unrelated to React's and are append-only so an already-deployed bundle continues
to decode correctly. Compiler diagnostics keep their symbolic `OCTANE_*` codes,
and user-thrown or transported error messages are never rewritten as framework
errors.

## `class`/`className` compose clsx-style

```tsx
<div class={['button', { active: selected }, ['compact']]} />
// selected=true → class="button active compact"

<div className={['a', 'b']} />
// React: class="a,b"
// Octane: class="a b"
```

Strings, numbers, arrays, objects, and nesting compose at every client and SSR
apply site with byte-identical results. A nullish or `false` result removes the
attribute; an empty string writes `class=""`.

## Scoped `<style>`, `$class`, and `apply`

React has no styling primitive; Octane's `.tsrx` dialect has sibling-scoped
`<style>` blocks ([RFC tsrx-org/RFCs#1](https://github.com/tsrx-org/RFCs/discussions/1)),
covered in [tsrx-basics.md](./tsrx-basics.md#styles): a block styles its siblings and
everything below them, and sibling blocks share one hash. The contract in brief:

- A block is a child of an element or a fragment and styles the items beside
  it and everything below them; it never styles the element that contains it.
  Every children list holding a block is a scope with its own hash; blocks in
  one list share it and compile to one `injectStyle(hash, css)`. To style an
  element, make the block and the element fragment siblings. A `@{ … }` or
  directive body holds one output node, so a block beside it is the parser's
  multiple-outputs error; wrap both in a fragment.
- Raw CSS in `<style>` is TSRX template syntax, allowed only inside a
  `@{ … }` or `@if`/`@for`/`@switch`/`@try` body. Plain TSX keeps React's rule:
  `<style>{css}</style>` is an ordinary element, passed through untouched.
- Elements carry `authored classes, enclosing scope hashes (outer → inner),
  applied theme classes`, composed through the clsx rules above, so a
  `class={[…]}` value and the stamped hashes serialize identically on the client
  and the server.
- `const theme = <style>…</style>` is a class map: `{ $class: '<hash>',
  dark: '<hash> dark', … }`. `<style apply={theme} />` stamps `theme.$class` on
  a scope; `apply={[a, b]}` composes. Same-module targets inline as literals
  (static templates stay hoisted); imported targets are runtime `theme.$class`
  reads.
- CSS emits in lexical pre-order. On the client `injectStyle` is a module-level
  statement (import order orders sheets across modules); on the server it runs
  inside the component body per request, so a render collects CSS only for the
  components it rendered. A control-flow scope's CSS always ships; only the
  class stamping follows the branch.
- `<style href precedence>` is a Float resource (below) and stays outside the
  scope model.

The compiler reports these as compile errors, each carrying its code:

- `STYLE_APPLY_VALUE` — `apply` needs an expression: `apply={theme}` or
  `apply={[a, b]}`.
- `STYLE_APPLY_TARGET` — the value does not resolve to a `<style>` block or an
  import (a spread or hole in the array counts).
- `STYLE_APPLY_BEFORE_DECLARATION` — the target block is declared after the
  block that applies it.
- `STYLE_APPLY_DUPLICATE` — a block has two `apply` attributes; pass an array.
- `STYLE_APPLY_UNSUPPORTED_HOST` — `apply` on a `<style href precedence>`
  resource or a `<style>` inside `<head>`.
- `STYLE_RESERVED_CLASS_KEY` — a `.$class` selector in an assigned block.
- `STYLE_STANDALONE_AT_MODULE_SCOPE` — a bodied `<style>` statement at module
  scope that is not assigned.
- `STYLE_STANDALONE_OUTSIDE_TEMPLATE` — raw CSS in a `<style>` outside every
  `@{ … }` or `@if`/`@for`/`@switch`/`@try` body (a plain `return <…>` function,
  a module-scope element). Use `<style>{css}</style>` in TSX, or assign the
  block.
- `STYLE_STANDALONE_NEEDS_FRAGMENT` — a `<style>` as the lone output of a
  `@{ … }` or directive body. Wrap it with the output it styles in a fragment.
- `STYLE_UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE` — any attribute other than `apply` on a scoped
  block.
- `CSS_GLOBAL_PLACEMENT` — `:global(...)` in the middle of a selector sequence
  or nested inside a pseudo-class.

## Context: direct provider component, no Provider or Consumer

`createContext` returns a context that is itself the provider component —
React 19's `<MyContext value={…}>` form is the supported shape.
`MyContext.Provider` does not exist. The compiler reports
`OCTANE_CONTEXT_PROVIDER` when the context is created in the same module; for an
imported context, reading `.Provider` in development throws the same
`OCTANE_CONTEXT_PROVIDER` error on client and server (production bundles carry
no check and the property is `undefined`). Replace
`<MyContext.Provider value={value}>` with `<MyContext value={value}>`, and pass
`MyContext` directly to `createElement`
or `root.render`. The render-prop `<MyContext.Consumer>` does not exist and
will not be added: Octane's slot-keyed hooks make `use(MyContext)`/`useContext`
legal behind any condition, which is the pattern Consumer existed to work around.
Read the context in the child (or an inline component) instead.

Production DOM compilation can omit generic descriptor-child rendering for a
private context when its complete usage is proven to be compiled template
providers and canonical `use`/`useContext` reads. Exported or escaped contexts,
aliases, reflection, and opaque children retain generic rendering. This changes
bundle reachability while preserving context identity, hook state, hydration
adoption, and uncontrolled edits across provider value updates. Development,
HMR, profiling, server, and custom-renderer compilation keep the generic path.

In development, accessing `.Consumer` logs a one-time migration diagnostic and
still returns `undefined`, so feature probes (`MyContext.Consumer || fallback`)
behave exactly as in production. The upstream Consumer test scenarios that
protect observable behavior (defaults, propagation, bailout, hidden subtrees,
suspended boundaries) are ported with `useContext`-reading components; the
scenarios that exist only to exercise the render-prop API surface are recorded
as non-goals in the parity ledger.

## Document metadata and Float resources

Hoisted `<title>`/`<meta>`/`<link>` follow React 19's model with three
differences:

- **Ownership is per compile site, not per content.** Each authored element
  owns one head element; two components (or two renders of one component list
  item) each rendering `<meta name="description">` produce two tags, where
  React dedupes links by href and treats `<title>` as a singleton. An
  element's tag updates reactively and is removed when its owning scope
  unmounts.
- **`<title>` accepts any children Octane can stringify** — multiple children
  and expressions concatenate. React 19 errors on non-string title children.
- **Hydration moves folded metadata into `document.head`.** A body-only render
  prepends its hoisted metadata to `html`. When that whole `html` fills the
  hydrating container, `hydrateRoot` moves each metadata entry into
  `document.head` and adopts it there, so the hydrated DOM matches a client
  render. React adopts the element where it lies in the container. Folded Float
  resources and hints stay in place in both.

Metadata and resources hoist from ANY depth, matching React: an element
nested inside a host partitions out of the body on both the client and the
server, and a hoist inside an `@if` arm registers only while that arm renders.
Two more Fizz-parity behaviors on the server: `<meta charSet>` and
`<meta name="viewport">` serialize at the FRONT of the head (charset first —
parsers only honor it within the first 1024 bytes — then viewport, then
everything else in discovery order), and hoistables authored inside a pending
boundary's fallback are dropped transitively (a completed boundary nested in a
fallback is still fallback territory; the streamed head would outlive the
fallback it came from).

React Float **resources** are supported with React's semantics:

- `<link rel="stylesheet" href precedence>` (no `onLoad`/`onError`) is a
  global resource: deduped by href across the page, hoisted into
  `document.head` with a `data-precedence` attribute, grouped by precedence in
  first-encounter order (later same-precedence sheets append to their group),
  and retained after unmount. First encounter follows tree discovery order —
  parent before child, suspended arms at reveal — so client mounts, SSR, and
  React agree on group order. First instance wins; later differing props do
  not retarget a live sheet.
- `<script async src>` (no children/handlers) hoists and dedupes by src, and
  is likewise never removed.
- `<style href precedence>` is a STYLE RESOURCE: its plain CSS ships by href
  identity, sharing the stylesheet dedupe namespace and precedence-group
  ordering with link resources (`data-precedence`/`data-href` mark the tags).
  The CSS is NOT scoped — every other `<style>`, whether standalone in a
  template scope or assigned (`const theme = <style>…</style>`), belongs to
  Octane's sibling-scope model above, and `apply` on a resource is an error
  (`STYLE_APPLY_UNSUPPORTED_HOST`). Two adaptations: Octane emits one `<style>`
  tag per resource rather than merging same-precedence rules into a single tag
  (grouping and order are preserved), and CSS containing `</style` fails
  closed in SSR with a development diagnostic (raw-text serialization cannot
  escape it; the client inserts via `textContent`, which is always safe).
- `preloadModule`/`preinitModule` join `preload`/`preinit`/`preconnect`/
  `prefetchDNS`.
- Classification is static: a spread-carried `precedence`/`async` keeps the
  ordinary element path, matching the compile-time head-hoist model.
- React's hoist EXCLUSIONS apply: `itemProp`-bearing `<meta>`/`<link>` stay
  with their `itemScope` host; metadata/resources that are direct children
  of `<noscript>` stay in the fallback content (one nesting level today —
  metadata wrapped in a further host INSIDE `<noscript>` still hoists; a
  documented bound, not a contract); and nothing hoists from an SVG lexical
  scope (`foreignObject` children re-enter the HTML rules). One template-model
  bound: `<meta>` inside `<svg>` on a pure client mount is relocated by the
  HTML parser's foreign-content breakout rules — it still never becomes
  document metadata, but it cannot be kept inside the `<svg>` the way React's
  imperative element construction keeps it. SSR serializes it inline correctly.

Out of scope, deliberately: **suspensey commits** (React's
suspend-until-the-stylesheet-loads behavior; Octane inserts the sheet and
continues).

Resource hints share the Float identity model — including React's option
semantics: font preloads always emit `crossorigin=""` (anonymous) regardless of
the caller's value; connection/integrity options seeded by a `preload` carry
onto the matching `preinit`'s real tag (and the server coalesces the redundant
preload out of the head fold); `preconnect` identity includes the CORS mode;
responsive image preloads (`imageSrcSet`) omit the fallback `href`; unknown
option keys are dropped; non-string hrefs warn in development and no-op; and a
module src is ONE executable identity across `preinitModule` and
`<script async type="module" src>` on both the server pass and the hydrating
client. In detail: `preinit(href, {as: 'style'})`
IS a stylesheet resource (it honors a `precedence` option, default
`"default"`, joins the precedence groups, and dedupes against
`<link rel="stylesheet" precedence>`), `preinit(as: 'script')` dedupes against
`<script async src>`, and a `preload`/`preloadModule` issued after the
matching init is a no-op (the upgrade is one-way: preload-then-init keeps both
tags). Image preloads carrying `imageSrcSet` key on the srcset+sizes pair
rather than the fallback href. Malformed calls (missing/invalid `as`, empty
href) warn in development and stay no-ops. Options serialize through their
canonical attributes (`fetchPriority`, `imageSrcSet`, `imageSizes`, `media`,
`integrity`, …); unknown option keys are dropped, matching React.

## Reconciler: LIS moves, identical results

The keyed reconciler minimizes DOM moves (LIS) instead of React's
`lastPlacedIndex`. Survivor node identity and final order are guaranteed and
stress-tested (including under mid-reconcile throws); only the set of
physically-moved nodes can differ.

## Scheduler: synchronous, two priorities

Renders run to completion — no lanes beyond the two priorities, yields,
time-slicing, expiration, or selective hydration. Urgent renders are
microtask-batched. Priority changes Suspense behavior, and where the render runs:

```tsx
setPage(next); // If it suspends, show the pending fallback.
startTransition(() => setPage(next)); // Keep the previous content while pending.
```

Transition-priority renders run in a later host task, never in the microtask
checkpoint of the urgent commit before them, as React renders a transition lane in
a Scheduler task. The browser can therefore paint that commit and deliver input
first, and a burst of ready continuations renders once: a backlog of `useActionState`
results, a transition started after each `await`, or the post-`await` updates of
several Actions that settle together. Octane posts the task with
`scheduler.postTask` where available, then `MessageChannel`, then `setTimeout`.
Waiting there are updates inside `startTransition`, Action results, and, while an
async Action is pending, every update made outside a delegated event, `flushSync`,
or a commit callback, which Octane already treats as part of the Action. Three kinds
of update keep the microtask flush at their transition priority, because they
announce the transition rather than complete it: `useTransition` and
`useActionState` raising `isPending`, and `useOptimistic` showing a value. A cue
renders without the transition's own updates, even in the component that holds
them: that render shows their previous values, and the component renders them in
the task, as React renders the cue in an urgent lane. `isPending` falls right after
that render, in the same task. The cue still renders the transition's work with it
when that work is not hook state, or when the component is inside a Suspense
boundary that is holding a suspended transition. An urgent update to a component
whose transition is waiting renders it in the microtask flush. `flushSync` and
`act()` drain both priorities. An Action pending cue on its own does not start
native View Transition capture, and neither does a cue rendered apart from its
component's waiting transition. Explicit transition work keeps its capture when it
reaches the render queue, including state in the same component as the cue.

`useDeferredValue`'s deferred render also runs in a later host task. Urgent updates
that arrive before the task runs only change the value it renders, so a fast typist's
skipped values never render deferred. There is still no time-slicing: once a
transition or deferred render starts it runs to completion, and a keystroke that
arrives during it waits until it commits, where React would yield to handle it.

Ready query and asynchronous `derived$` publications coalesce native component
rendering in the same host-task queue. Source subscriptions, graph effects, and
direct signal bindings still observe every publication. Plain signal writes,
native events, lifecycle updates, and `flushSync` retain their existing timing.
The admission change does not turn an urgent signal render into a Suspense
transition; held native-read frames keep their existing retention policy.

Query and derived stream pulls share an approximately 5 ms host budget. Both a
pull and a ready-result publication check the same window, so many producers do
not each receive a separate allowance. A posted sentinel resets that window;
ready continuations wait for it when the budget is spent, then recheck their
current producer lease. Ordered values, cancellation, and server observation
backpressure are preserved. This is a scheduling opportunity between complete
units, not a hard 5 ms limit: one iterator call, subscriber, render, or commit can
itself take longer. Cold I/O lets the sentinel run between results.

Native `ResizeObserver` callbacks run inside the browser's resize delivery loop.
An ordinary microtask commit that resizes an already-delivered target can trigger
`ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications`, even when the
layout eventually settles. A transition-only update renders in a later task, outside
that loop, but an urgent update or `flushSync` still commits inside it.
Use Octane's `createResizeObserver` when a callback updates state or writes DOM
that can resize its observed targets:

```ts
import { createResizeObserver } from 'octane';

const observer = createResizeObserver((entries) => {
  setWidth(entries[0].contentRect.width);
});
observer.observe(element);
// Cleanup also discards callbacks that have not been delivered yet.
observer.disconnect();
```

The helper returns a native observer and delivers callbacks in a separate task,
coalescing entries per target and retaining the latest native measurement.
`unobserve` removes a target's queued entry; `disconnect` clears the batch and
the observer can be used again. Changing an observed target's box option also
discards its queued entry. Manage observation through the returned instance's
methods so deferred cleanup takes effect. Pass a second constructor argument,
such as `iframe.contentWindow.ResizeObserver`, to use another window's observer.

The global constructor and ordinary microtask batching stay unchanged. Native
observers in unmodified dependencies still need an adapter. Deferral moves
geometry changes outside the current delivery loop; it does not make a cyclic
resize calculation converge. Initial synchronous measurement can remain in a
layout effect before installing the observer.

See the [Core APIs resize measurement guide](https://octanejs.dev/docs/core-apis#createResizeObserver)
for a complete component and cleanup example.

Delegated events commit on React's `batchedUpdates` schedule. The outermost
dispatch of a discrete event such as `click`, `keydown`, `input`, or `submit`
flushes synchronously only when a controlled `value`/`checked` host armed a state
restore during that dispatch (an accepted edit commits, an unheard edit snaps
back, both before the dispatch returns). Every other handler update stays in the
microtask batch. For a browser-dispatched event that microtask runs before the
next native listener and before the default action, so later listeners and the
next interaction observe committed state; a script-dispatched event
(`dispatchEvent`, `click()`, `requestSubmit()`) commits only after the dispatching
script yields, so outside code that dispatches and then inspects the DOM sees the
same pre-commit state it would under React. Tests wrap dispatches in `act()` or
`flushSync()` for a synchronous commit, as with React. Continuous events such as
`mousemove`, `pointermove`, and `scroll` retain microtask batching; Octane does not
give them a separate interruptible priority lane. Ordinary delegated event updates
do not join an unrelated pending async Action, while an explicit
`startTransition` inside the handler still opts into transition work.

Already-visible Suspense content stays visible without a timeout during a
transition, matching React's
[shell-retention contract](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/6117d7cca4906492c51fe6a03381e35adfd86e7d/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js#L1356-L1369).
`isPending` stays true until the transition completes or is superseded. Initial
boundaries and newly added nested boundaries may show their fallbacks: there is
no previously visible content for those boundaries to preserve.

`setTransitionFallbackTimeout(ms)` is an Octane extension for applications that
want a finite deadline. After that deadline, the pending fallback replaces the
visible primary while `isPending` remains true. `getTransitionFallbackTimeout()`
returns `Infinity` by default; setting `Infinity` restores the no-timeout policy
for subsequent holds.

`flushSync` drains both priorities but leaves passive effects asynchronous:

```tsx
flushSync(() => {
  setQuery('octane');
  startTransition(() => setResults(nextResults));
});
// Both updates committed; passive effects still run later.
```

Passive effects normally run after paint, including effects queued by discrete
events and external-store updates. A listener installed by `useEffect` can miss
another event dispatched before that drain. Use `useLayoutEffect` when the
subscription must be installed by the end of the commit. Passive timing is not
React's synchronous discrete-event effect timing.

`root.unmount()` drains pending passive work and its passive cleanups before
returning, so root-owned subscriptions cannot outlive the unmount call.

Octane also skips React's extra same-value render after a previous state change.
If a component body does run, its children can render even when the final state
is unchanged; do not depend on React's incidental render counts. Updates across
roots share a microtask wave, and an `await` continuation can observe the commit
after an urgent `setState(); await 0`. A transition commits in a later host task. Cross-component render-time updates join the current
drain. Finite layout-effect cascades complete before DOM mutation observers run,
including commits started by the scheduler. `flushSync` drains them before returning.

Commit phases retain Octane's ordering: insertion effects mount with connected
DOM, refs attach before layout bodies, and layout cleanups can observe DOM
already changed by the render walk. A changed ref detaches after its owner's
layout cleanup; deletion cleanups interleave insertion and layout work. This
does not provide React's per-component ref/layout interleaving or a global
before-mutation ref-detach phase.

Other consequences:

- Priority (`urgent` vs `transition`) governs Suspense hold semantics and
  whether a render waits for a later host task (above), not time-slicing.
- Fallback-visible boundaries whose retries fully stage reveal together,
  including refs and layout effects.
- Retry-only Suspense reveals use a shared 100ms fallback window (React uses
  300ms). Ready content can therefore appear sooner after a fallback is shown.
  Showing or filling a fallback advances the window, and retries wait if more
  than 10ms remains. Urgent updates and active `act()` scopes bypass this delay.
  A committed fallback inside hidden Activity contributes to the window;
  toggling Activity visibility alone does not.
  This is separate from the indefinite transition hold above; see
  [Suspense retry timing](../packages/octane/audit/SUSPENSE_DIVERGENCE.md#5-retry-reveal-throttling--distinct-from-transition-shell-retention).
- Resource readers can suspend by throwing a thenable during render, on the
  client and during SSR; `use()` is not required. Pending and error fallback
  renders can also suspend through an enclosing pending boundary. A catch-only
  error boundary does not own suspension; promises thrown by effects remain
  application errors.
- A Suspense retry runs on the settling thenable's microtask; React waits for a
  Scheduler task. If the retry suspends again on a thenable Octane has already
  seen settle, the next retry yields one macrotask after that thenable notifies,
  as React's does. A resource reader whose state lags its resolved promise, or
  `use()` of a thenable with a status React does not recognize, can then keep
  suspending until a later task changes its state without starving timers or
  network callbacks. See
  [retry pacing](../packages/octane/audit/SUSPENSE_DIVERGENCE.md#13-retry-pacing-after-an-already-settled-wakeable).
- On the server, a reader can keep rethrowing a thenable that has already
  settled until a later task updates its state. React's `prerender` retries
  that on microtasks indefinitely, starving timers, and its streams retry once
  per task without a limit. Octane's SSR retries on a timer that backs off from
  1ms to 100ms once it has seen the thenable settle. In a stream, any other data
  that arrives ends that wait. These retries do not count toward the pass
  limits, and the render fails once the stall lasts `timeoutMs`. See
  [server retries](../packages/octane/audit/SUSPENSE_DIVERGENCE.md#9-resource-thrown-thenables--render-suspension-gap-closed).
- Without an enclosing Suspense/`@pending` boundary, the client root retains its
  committed screen, or stays empty on an initial mount, and retries when the
  thenable settles. Urgent and transition updates retry the latest inputs;
  superseding requests and unmounts cannot reveal stale work. Initially suspended
  hydration retains the server DOM until it can adopt it, attach refs, and run
  layout/passive effects. Actual rejections follow normal
  error-boundary/root-error routing.
  See [root suspension coverage](../packages/octane/audit/SUSPENSE_DIVERGENCE.md#10-client-suspension-without-a-boundary--root-hold-and-retry)
  for the fix to [issue #821](https://github.com/octanejs/octane/issues/821).
- Incomplete descriptor and memoized subtrees retry before Suspense reveals
  them, preserving mounted state and DOM identity. Completed siblings whose
  speculative commit work was discarded are revisited; unaffected memo and
  identity bailouts remain eligible. See
  [descriptor retry coverage](../packages/octane/audit/SUSPENSE_DIVERGENCE.md#11-incomplete-descriptor-retry-bailouts).
- Same-identity synchronous rendering remains per-swap rather than using a
  global React-style work-in-progress tree. See
  [Suspense divergence #4](../packages/octane/audit/SUSPENSE_DIVERGENCE.md).
- Multiple unhandled root errors in one flush throw an `AggregateError`; an
  unhandled error unmounts its root's whole tree (both match React).
- `useSyncExternalStore` skips React's commit-time getSnapshot re-read for
  unchanged values (the concurrent-interleaving window it guards doesn't exist
  here).
- A hidden `<Activity>` subtree renders synchronously in the same pass — there
  is no offscreen/idle lane deprioritizing hidden work. Compatible state and DOM
  are preserved; refs and layout/passive effects disconnect while hidden and
  reconnect on reveal. Insertion effects stay connected. Hidden suspension is
  contained by the Activity, but general structural-deletion atomicity still has
  the per-swap limitation above. See the [Activity audit](./activity-audit.md).
- Suspense and Activity hide portal content with their ordinary descendants.
  Initially suspended primary DOM can remain connected but hidden before its
  first commit; hidden inputs still participate in native form submission and
  DOM queries still find those nodes. Effect/ref connection follows visibility,
  not physical DOM membership. Hook state created above the first suspending
  `use()` is retained for retry instead of discarding that initial state.
- `useId` generates `:<prefix>in-<n>:` identifiers (React 19.2 uses
  `_r_<n>_`). Both are opaque; only the format differs.
- `version` reports Octane's own package version (`0.x`), not a React version —
  ported code gating on `version >= '19'` must not rely on it. The same value is
  exported by the client, server, and static entry points.

## Parallel `use()`: no suspense waterfalls

The compiler always applies its
[parallel-`use()` transform](./suspense-parallel-use-plan.md). When it can prove
requests independent, idiomatic sequential `use()` code avoids the waterfall
React incurs for the same source:

```tsx
// These fetch functions are imported module bindings.
const profile = use(fetchProfile(id)); // Starts now.
const posts = use(fetchPosts(id)); // Starts with profile.
const avatar = use(fetchAvatar(profile.avatarId)); // Waits for profile.
```

The first two creations form one independent stratum: they start together and
the boundary suspends once for the batch. The third has a true data dependency
and remains sequential.

- **Creations are memoized per call site**: `use(fetchA(id))` compiles to a
  slot-keyed memo with member-path deps (`[fetchA, id]`), so replays never mint
  fresh promises and refetch happens exactly when inputs change.
- **A one-level method call is tracked by where its method lives**:
  `use(load(count.toFixed(1)))` tracks `count`, because an inherited method
  is one function for every receiver. A getter also tracks its receiver. An own
  function tracks only itself, whether it is an arrow or not, so
  `use(props.load(id))` keeps its request when the parent rebuilds `props`
  around the same `load`. Inferred hook dependencies differ here: an own
  non-arrow function there tracks its receiver. A `use()` memo keyed on a
  rebuilt `props` would start a fresh request on every parent render and every
  boundary retry. So an own `function` shared by several objects, called as
  `source.read()`, is not witnessed when only `source` changes. Pass the value
  it reads as an argument instead.
- **Fetch trees warm across components**: a suspended body prefetches
  descendants whose reachability and props are provably independent of the
  suspended data (compiled `__warm` plans, depth-capped recursion), so a nested
  async chain loads in max(latency), not levels × latency —
  `benchmarks/async-waterfall`: 20.1ms vs React's 307.3ms on a 10-level chain.
- Unwrap order, hydration-seed order, rejection routing (`@catch` receives the
  first-in-order reason), and `@pending`/transition semantics are unchanged.
- Runtime safety nets (React parity): a replay that
  creates a fresh promise for a slot that already holds one reuses the stored
  thenable ("uncached promise" dev warning), and a replay that discovers a new
  pending `use()` behind a data dependency gets a dev waterfall diagnostic.

Composition is regression-pinned in `benchmarks/async-composition`, whose
dashboard fixture reads eight resources — seven independent, one truly dependent
— through an imported custom hook and three sibling panels:

| Shape | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Independent `use()` calls inside an imported custom hook | Start together: plain TypeScript custom hooks get the same memoize-and-batch treatment as component-local `use()` |
| Adjacent async children under a parent with no `use()` | Start together: child warm plans register with active ancestors, so the first suspending descendant starts its siblings |
| A transition-wrapped update | Holds the boundary whole: no mixed old/new state, matching React |

All three reach the workload's true dependency floor — 2 waves and 8 requests for
both cold mount and transition update, against React's 6/3 waves and 35/25
requests — so only `owner` waits, on `project.ownerId`, and the update exposes
zero intermediate states, the same as React.

A held boundary holds all of its own content. Octane renders and mutates in one
walk, so a transition patches a boundary's bindings on the way down and only then
finds that a descendant suspends; the same happens when a held boundary replays
its body and part of the data has arrived. Both cases record what each binding
replaced and put it back if the attempt suspends, inside the flush that made the
change — nothing reaches the screen in between. Transitions stay monotonic: no
visible rollback, no invalid intermediate structure, and a dependent value never
renders against stale input.

Controlled `value`, `checked` and `selected` are held too. Each carries a
`default*` mirror and a record of what was last projected, and all of it goes
back together — restoring the node alone would leave the record believing the new
value had already landed, so re-projecting it on resume would be skipped.

A held synchronous transition now defers its whole commit: content the
transition patched outside the suspended boundary — shell text, attributes,
keyed structure — reverts with the hold and lands in one step on resolve, with
`isPending` staying on throughout. `benchmarks/async-composition` pins the
update at zero exposed intermediate states, level with React. One residual is
pinned at its own ceiling there: after the dependent request resolves, the
promoted round re-creates the warm-started panel fetches (13 creations against
the 8-call floor; the app-level cache serves the same promises, so nothing
refetches over the network) until the resume/warm work in
[the deferred-commit plan](./transition-deferred-commit-plan.md) restores the
floor. Both need the transition to become a deferred commit — a keyed
removal disposes blocks and runs their cleanups, which cannot be undone, and
reverting content outside a boundary needs the reveal to re-render where the
transition began rather than just the boundary. See
[Suspense divergence #4](../packages/octane/audit/SUSPENSE_DIVERGENCE.md). The
benchmark pins the exposed-state count at zero.

## Root component entry points and container ownership

Both entry forms are valid:

```tsx
// Choose either entry form:
root.render(<App />); // React-compatible
// or
root.render(App, props); // Octane extension
```

The second form avoids creating an element descriptor at application bootstrap.
A bare function passed to `root.render` is therefore intentional, not an
invalid-child warning.

Both `createRoot` and `hydrateRoot` accept an `Element`, a `Document`, or a
`DocumentFragment` (including `ShadowRoot`). Document roots own the document
element and preserve its doctype.

A document root replaces the document shell when its output does not contain
`<html>` and `<body>`. In that case `document.body` is `null`, so it cannot be
passed to another `createRoot` call. Update the existing document root or render
a complete document shell first.

The first `root.render()` mounts synchronously. React's concurrent root queues
its initial mount, so a render followed by an unmount in the same surrounding
batch exposes no intermediate DOM there; Octane may expose the mounted DOM
before its synchronous unmount leaves the same empty final state.

```tsx
root.render(App, props);
console.log(container.firstChild !== null); // true
```

After `root.unmount()`, the root is permanently closed. If outside code removes
some of a root's managed DOM first, unmount still performs safe cleanup instead
of surfacing the browser's incidental `NotFoundError` from removing an already
detached node.

## Portal keys and component props

`createPortal(children, target, key)` accepts a string or number key, normalized
to a string, so keyed portal arrays preserve their child state on reordering.
Octane also supports a component body as the first argument and an object of
component props as the third:

```tsx
createPortal(<Menu />, overlay, 'menu');
createPortal(Menu, overlay, { open: true });
```

The object overload does not supply a reconciliation key. Use a keyed element
inside the portal or the keyed renderable overload when identity must change.

## Parameters after `props`

A component takes its props as its first argument. Octane reserves the
arguments after it for the renderer, so while a component renders, the
parameters after `props` receive internal values where React passes
`undefined`. Pass a component's inputs through props. A `@{ … }` component
binds each parameter exactly like its returned-JSX form:

```tsx
function Row(props, extra) @{
  <li>{props.label}</li>
}
// Means: function Row(props, extra) { return <li>{props.label}</li>; }
```

## `lazy()` module resolution

Like React, `lazy(load)` accepts a thenable that resolves to a module object with
a `default` component. Octane additionally accepts a bare component as the
resolved value, making named dynamic imports usable without a default-export
shim:

```tsx
const Chart = lazy(() =>
  import('./Chart').then((module) => module.Chart),
);
```

Creating a lazy wrapper does not call its loader. When an independently
reachable sibling suspends, Octane may start the lazy module's existing loader
early so its code loads alongside the pending work. The loader still runs only
once per wrapper, and its resolved component and default-export getter are not
evaluated until that component actually renders. Discovery does not cross a
dormant deferred-hydration boundary.

Nested lazy wrappers are rejected.

React's Suspense and ViewTransition values are exotic element types and React
rejects wrapping them in `lazy()`. Octane exposes those boundaries as ordinary
component functions, so a lazy wrapper preserves their normal component
behavior.

## Errors: `@try` / `@catch`, not class boundaries

```tsx
@try {
  <RiskyPanel />
} @catch (error, reset) {
  <button onClick={() => reset()}>Retry</button>
}
```

`@catch (error, reset)` and the JSX `<ErrorBoundary>` replace class
error-boundary lifecycles. Catch fallbacks mount fresh nodes (like React's
`forceUnmountCurrentAndReconcile`); deletion-phase and ref-detach errors route
to the enclosing boundary.

React 19's root error-callback options are supported on `createRoot` and
`hydrateRoot`: `onCaughtError` (a boundary claimed an error from the render,
passive-effect, or ref-attach channel), `onUncaughtError` (no boundary claimed
it — providing the callback replaces the default report, which otherwise
rethrows render errors out of the flush and `console.error`s effect-channel
errors; the failed root's tree still unmounts), and `onRecoverableError`
(a hydration mismatch made the nearest fallback boundary, or the root, discard
its server DOM and render on the client — see the hydration section).
Each callback receives only the error: there is no `errorInfo`/`componentStack`
second argument, matching the documented SSR `onError` shape (owner stacks are
not part of Octane's API). Deletion-phase teardown errors (effect cleanups and
ref detaches thrown while a subtree unmounts) keep their existing boundary
routing and report through the same callbacks: boundary-claimed →
`onCaughtError`, unclaimed → `onUncaughtError` (else the default
`console.error`).

In non-suspending renders, first-mount and parent-driven catches report the
original error once after the fallback commits, including its refs and layout
effects. Inline reports retained by Suspense or Activity wait for reveal, and
are discarded if their catch is abandoned before that commit.

## Refs are props

Components receive refs as ordinary props; there is no `forwardRef` wrapper:

```tsx
function Search({ ref }) @{
  <input ref={ref} />
}

<Search ref={[inputRef, measure]} />
```

A ref may be a callback, a `{ current }` object, or an array of refs as shown
above.

Octane also supports lazy initialization of a mutable ref with
`useLazyRef(() => createValue())`. Plain `useRef(callback)` retains React-compatible
behavior and stores the callback itself. The lazy factory runs during render, so
abandoned work, retries, remounts, and separate server and hydration renders can
invoke it again; keep it free of side effects and use an effect for resources
requiring cleanup. Strong mode checks the factory like a lazy `useState`
initializer: it may read a clock, randomness, or browser state for the initial
value, but it may not schedule work. The experimental Valdi writer's existing
adapter ABI does not support this hook.

### Fragment refs

An explicit `<Fragment ref={ref}>` provides a typed `FragmentInstance` without
adding a wrapper element. This matches React's Canary Fragment-ref API; the
`<>...</>` shorthand cannot accept a ref.

Refs also work through imported aliases, namespace members, JSX spreads, and
`createElement(Fragment, { ref }, ...)` descriptors.

```tsx
import { Fragment, type FragmentInstance, useRef } from 'octane';

function SearchFields() {
  const fields = useRef<FragmentInstance | null>(null);

  return (
    <Fragment ref={fields}>
      <input />
      <button onClick={() => fields.current?.focus()}>Focus first field</button>
    </Fragment>
  );
}
```

`FragmentInstance` exposes `addEventListener`, `removeEventListener`,
`dispatchEvent`, `focus`, `focusLast`, `blur`, `observeUsing`, `unobserveUsing`,
`getClientRects`, `getRootNode`, `compareDocumentPosition`, and
`scrollIntoView`. Event listeners, observers, geometry, and scrolling target the
Fragment's first-level DOM children; focus searches descendants depth-first.
`scrollIntoView` accepts only an optional alignment boolean, not an options
object. First-level children expose their owning instances through
`reactFragments: Set<FragmentInstance>`.

Fragment refs are inactive during server rendering and attach during client
hydration.

## SSR and streaming

### Rendering surface

The buffered renderers return Octane's scoped CSS beside the HTML:

```tsx
const { html, css } = renderToString(App, props);
```

Renderable roots are also accepted: `renderToString(createElement(App), options)`
and primitive, array, or null roots use the second argument for renderer options.
The function-root extension uses `renderToString(App, props, options)`.

`renderToString`, `renderToStaticMarkup`, and `prerender` all return
`{ html, css }`; React has no equivalent `css` field. `css` holds one
`<style data-octane="hash">` tag per style scope the request rendered — a
component contributes one per sibling scope it owns — deduped by hash. Hoisted document metadata
folds into `html` as React does. For a host that owns the surrounding
`<head>`-bearing template, `headChannel: 'separate'` instead exposes
`RenderResult.head` and `StreamOptions.onHeadReady`.

Plain string returns are text and are escaped. The compiler brands its already
serialized HTML internally; user components must use descriptors or templates
for markup. Style text uses raw CSS serialization, and script/style closing
sequences are hardened to prevent an embedded closing tag from ending the host.

Serialization is not byte-identical to React: entity spelling, trailing CSS
semicolons, boolean-attribute spelling, and empty comment separators can differ.
`renderToStaticMarkup` retains Octane's separators. Automatic image preload hints
are not synthesized. Host props remain lenient for custom-element objects,
attributes such as `selected` on unrelated hosts, and void elements with
children. Server style inputs accept strings and other values the style
normalizer accepts, in addition to ordinary objects.

Server `useSyncExternalStore` falls back to `getSnapshot` when
`getServerSnapshot` is absent. Transition starters and optimistic setters from
server hooks are no-ops; a server hook's transition starter does not invoke its
callback. Portals emit an empty placeholder. Unlike React's client-only error
boundaries, template `@catch` also catches during SSR. JSX Suspense errors render
its fallback and notify `onError`; a pending promise with no boundary makes a
synchronous buffered render throw instead of returning partial HTML.

### Streaming

`renderToPipeableStream` and `renderToReadableStream` stream out-of-order
Suspense like Fizz, with these differences:

- Octane performs per-round re-passes (the prerender cost model), not
  per-boundary incremental renders.
- There is no selective hydration.
- Head elements hoisted inside streamed boundaries are re-created on the client
  during hydration.

Octane leaves document and transport orchestration to the surrounding server.
It has no Fizz bootstrap-script/module/import-map options, no doctype/preamble
*options* (streaming a `<html>`-rooted document still emits `<!DOCTYPE html>`
automatically), and no `onHeaders` or header-construction options. One `nonce`
covers every inline style and script Octane emits rather than exposing separate
script and style channels. `progressiveChunkSize` does not exist — Octane
flushes per resolution wave, not by byte thresholds — and `namespaceURI` is
inferred from the rendered root rather than accepted as an option.

React 19.2's partial pre-rendering — `resume`, `resumeToPipeableStream`,
`resumeAndPrerender`, and the postpone/prelude protocol — is a non-goal: that
request protocol is not part of Octane's public SSR surface. Relatedly,
`prerender` resolves `{ html, css }` (a complete buffered document), not
React's `{ prelude: ReadableStream }`. `prerenderToNodeStream` is implemented:
it resolves after the complete render and exposes that complete document as a
Node stream in `prelude`.

A readable stream's `allReady` settles after all boundary bytes have been
accepted under consumer backpressure, so consumers should read the stream while
awaiting it. Error callbacks report the original value without synthesizing
React digests or React's `errorInfo` shape.

A pipeable stream's shell failure calls the destination's `destroy(error)` when
available, including when piping begins after the failure. A minimal destination
without `destroy` receives no body bytes and ends after `onShellError` reports
the failure; its owner must choose the transport response.

### Hydration

Mismatches are handled as React 19 handles them. Nothing is repaired in
place. When the server's HTML differs structurally from the client render (a
different tag, a missing node, or server content the client renders nothing
for) or its text differs, the nearest fallback boundary discards its server
DOM and renders on the client. The boundaries are Suspense and `@try` regions
the server rendered with boundary markers, `<Hydrate>` islands, and, as the
last resort, the root. Sibling boundaries keep hydrating. `onRecoverableError`
fires once per boundary that falls back, in development and production, and a
root's hydrating attempt reports only if it commits. `ErrorBoundary` and
`@catch` are not hydration boundaries.

As in React:

- Attributes are never patched. An adopted element keeps the server's value
  until the client next changes it. Development logs one "won't be patched up"
  warning per hydration pass; production compares nothing. A `<textarea>`'s
  text takes the client's value.
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` keeps the server's HTML in the same way, and
  production compares nothing. The next render that passes an `__html` object
  rewrites it, even with the same string.
- Texts that match after the HTML parser's normalization (CRLF to LF,
  stripped `\u0000` and `\uFFFD`) count as a match, and the server text stays.
  `suppressHydrationWarning` keeps the server text one level deep. It never
  hides a structural mismatch.
- The root's container and `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` skip server
  elements that do not match, and comments, such as ones a browser extension
  inserted, and leave them in place, together with any server content after
  the client's. A text node there is a mismatch.
- A root that falls back clears its container. A `<head>` or `<body>`
  container keeps its scripts, styles and stylesheet links. Octane has no
  host singletons, so unlike React a `Document` or `<html>` container does
  not keep its existing `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` elements, or the
  scripts, styles and stylesheet links inside them: the client render's own
  elements replace them. A `Document` keeps its doctype.
- A suspension while hydrating keeps the server HTML; it never causes a
  fallback.

A boundary that falls back renders from client data. The `use()` values its
attempt read from the server's seeds are discarded, and so is captured
interaction intent whose target was in the discarded DOM. An early host
binding (`adoptBindings`, a behavior root) whose server DOM lies in a
boundary that falls back loses it: its lease ends when the fallback commits,
its cleanup runs once, and it stops writing, even if its host was moved
elsewhere while the boundary was pending. A boundary whose captures changed
before it activated (a dormant `<Hydrate>` island) falls back without a
report when its server content differs, as React reports nothing for an
update that reaches a dehydrated boundary.

Two differences are intentional. Matching React exactly would mean shipping
and running a structural comparison of everything hydration adopts, which is
the work compiled templates exist to avoid.

First, control-flow ranges are part of the hydration protocol, as React's
Suspense markers are part of React's. A client `@if` or `@switch` branch, or a
catch-only `@try` or `ErrorBoundary`, whose server output has no range of its
own is a structural mismatch and falls back, even where the elements inside
it match; React, which has no markers for them, adopts them. (A `@try` with
`@pending` is a Suspense boundary, so React falls back there too.) The markers
do not record which arm rendered, so an arm whose elements match the server's
arm adopts them, as in React.

Second, development compares a template's static structure and attributes and warns
about differences, but development-only comparisons never cause a fallback,
so development and production adopt the same DOM. Production validates a
template root's node type and tag, together with its dynamic binding and range
sites, and does not walk arbitrary static descendants. Unlike React's full
hydration walk, two static branches that share a root tag are not told apart:

```html
<!-- Server branch -->
<span class="compact">...</span>

<!-- Client branch -->
<span class="expanded">...</span>
```

A `@try` body whose server render threw adopts the server's `@catch` arm
rather than rendering the boundary on the client (template `@catch` also
catches during SSR).

A `<Hydrate>` boundary replays captured interaction events as constructed,
untrusted copies that keep the captured event's `timeStamp`, including through
nested boundaries. React replays only the continuous events (`focusin`,
`dragenter`, `mouseover`, `pointerover`, `gotpointercapture`) that arrive
before their target hydrates, as `new nativeEvent.constructor(type,
nativeEvent)` copies, and their `timeStamp` is the replay time. React never
replays a discrete event: it tries to hydrate the target synchronously and then
dispatches the original event to whatever has hydrated.

That includes the rest of a pointer press. An `interaction()` boundary that
selects `pointermove`, `pointerup`, or `pointercancel` captures them after a
selected press wakes it and replays them in order once it hydrates (see
[Pointer press lifecycle](./deferred-hydration.md#pointer-press-lifecycle)).
React drops a `pointerup` or `pointercancel` whose target is still suspended
after that synchronous attempt, and never delivers `pointermove` to a dehydrated
subtree's handlers. Neither framework cancels the native default of these
events.

Octane replays after the boundary's hydration commits and its effects run,
which can be a frame later. A boundary or independent island keeps capturing
its interaction events until that replay runs, so one arriving in between is
replayed after the captured ones instead of reaching the hydrated handlers
first. Handlers see those events in the order the user produced them, as in
React.

`hydrateRoot` has no `formState` option: resuming `useActionState` from an MPA
form POST requires React's server-action state serialization, which is part of
the RSC model Octane does not implement (the matching `useActionState`
`permalink` argument is accepted for signature parity and ignored).

## Hot module updates remount the edited component

React Fast Refresh diffs the new element tree against the existing fiber tree, so
an edit high in the tree can leave untouched descendants exactly where they were,
DOM nodes and state included.

Octane's compiled bodies clone a static template and address it through a
compile-time slot layout, so there is no element tree to diff. A hot update
discards the edited component's committed render state and remounts it in place:

- The component's own `useState`, `useReducer`, `useRef`, and `useId` values
  survive. Hook slots are keyed by
  `Symbol.for('octane:<file>:<Component>.<hook>#<n>')`, and a re-imported module
  produces the same Symbol identity.
- Its memo and effect dependencies are invalidated, so an edited closure runs
  again even when its authored dependency array did not change.
- Everything it rendered is torn down and rebuilt: descendant components, their
  state, their DOM identity, and uncontrolled input values. React would have kept
  the ones the edit did not touch.

A remount inside a hidden `<Activity>` remains hidden. Independently scheduled
descendant renders and Suspense resumes reapply the nearest Activity's hide pass
to any replacement elements or text, including output rebuilt by HMR, and reveal
restores the authored display and text values. Activity and Suspense share hide
ownership for overlapping DOM, so either boundary can reveal first without
exposing the other boundary's content or capturing its temporary hidden styles
as authored state.

Octane declines a refresh when the old and new compiler bodies use incompatible
direct-template and returned-output layouts, or when a live block has no coherent,
exclusively resettable DOM range. The emitted accept block then calls
`import.meta.hot.invalidate()` for a full page reload.

Hook slot ids are numbered per module in source order, so inserting or reordering
a hook call shifts every later hook's key in that file and remaps its state. That
is a known limitation, not a supported edit.

## Element-scoped View Transitions

Octane adds `scope="element"` to `ViewTransition`. A persistent direct host owns
its native capture, descendant names, and pseudo-element handles. Independent
scopes can animate concurrently after capture, while a batch spanning scopes
still publishes one DOM commit. Omitted scopes inherit their nearest declaration
or use the document. This extension falls back to a normal commit when
`Element.startViewTransition` is unavailable; it is not a React 19.3 API.
See [View Transitions](view-transitions.md#element-scopes) for host constraints,
scheduling, and browser support.

## Not implemented (by design)

Octane does not implement:

- class components or legacy `ReactDOM.render` roots;
- Server Components/RSC, including `cache()`, `cacheSignal()`, and
  `hydrateRoot`'s `formState` option;
- `StrictMode` double-invoke;
- `Profiler`, `SuspenseList`, `forwardRef`, or `createRef`;
- `captureOwnerStack` and development owner-stack collection (diagnostics
  dedupe per rendering block instead);
- partial pre-rendering (`resume`/`resumeAndPrerender` and the
  postpone/prelude protocol — see SSR and streaming);
- gesture View Transitions (`useSwipeTransition` /
  `unstable_startGestureTransition`), deferred until React stabilizes them.

`useDebugValue` is accepted as a no-op. Resource hints are supported
(`preload`, `preinit`, `preloadModule`, `preinitModule`, `preconnect`, and
`prefetchDNS`).

`StrictMode` is a pass-through wrapper; it does not replay renders or effects.
`unstable_batchedUpdates` invokes its callback and preserves its arguments,
result, and thrown errors because updates are already microtask-batched.
`useFormState` is accepted as a deprecated alias for `useActionState`.
`unstable_Activity` remains a compatibility alias for Octane's `Activity`; React
19.2.7 does not export that legacy name.

React 19 custom-element listener semantics are also supported: a
function-valued custom `on*` prop attaches a real listener with the exact event
name after `on`. For example, `onFooBar` listens for `FooBar`, while `onfoobar`
listens for `foobar`; a trailing `Capture` selects capture. Recognized DOM
handler names retain their native delegated behavior. The property-versus-attribute heuristic is
not; custom-element values follow Octane's attribute-only pass-through policy.
