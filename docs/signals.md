# Signals

`octane/signals` is Octane's stable, renderer-independent API for writable state, derived values, keyed async sources, and streams. `signal$`, `derived$`, and `query$` are declaration facades: the compiler assigns their stable source identities, while the current request, document or feature instance owns their cells. Compiled browser modules can read and write global signals without creating a renderer root. Server reads/writes require a request owner; there is no mutable process-global fallback. Native component reads and `useSignal$` work with the standard Octane compiler; no signal-specific compiler option is needed. Each module that consumes native reads needs a runtime import from `octane/signals`, `octane/signals/client`, or `octane/signals/server`, including modules that receive handles through props or call imported helpers. A `$` name alone does not enable native reads.

The [website guide](https://octanejs.dev/docs/signals) introduces the API, including a [complete streaming SSR example](https://octanejs.dev/docs/signals#streaming-example) and its [performance benefits](https://octanejs.dev/docs/signals#streaming-performance). This reference describes ownership, availability, and hydration in more detail. The [original implementation evidence](experimental-scoped-signals-evidence.md) and [implementation plan](plans/2026-08-27-experimental-scoped-async-signals-plan.md) are historical records.

The existing `@octanejs/alien-signals` binding remains a separate API. Explicit hook dependency arrays keep their existing meaning; inferred `useMemo` calls also track native reads made by their callback.

## Data ownership and immediate reads

The author-facing declarations separate writable data from read-only computation:

```ts
import { derived$, query$, signal$, skip } from 'octane/signals';

declare function fetchUser(
	id: string,
	options: { signal: AbortSignal; previous?: { id: string; name: string } },
): Promise<{ id: string; name: string }>;
declare function fetchPreview(id: string, options: { signal: AbortSignal }): Promise<string>;

const selectedId$ = signal$(null as string | null);
const draft$ = signal$('');
const user$ = query$(
	() => selectedId$.get() ?? skip,
	(id, { signal, previous }) => fetchUser(id, { signal, previous }),
);
const label$ = derived$(() => user$.get().name);
const preview$ = derived$(async ({ read, signal }) => {
	const user = await read(user$);
	return fetchPreview(user.id, { signal });
});
```

`signal$(initial)` is writable, and a function initial value is data. Setter functions retain updater semantics, so `handler$.set(() => nextHandler)` stores `nextHandler`. `derived$(compute)` is read-only and accepts an immediate value, a Promise, an `AsyncIterable`, or a Promise of an `AsyncIterable`. Its zero-argument synchronous path remains immediate. `query$(select, load)` tracks the synchronous selector and deduplicates canonical selected arguments within its owner. An optional trailing `{ key }` supplies explicit identity: `signal$('', { key: 'draft' })`, `derived$(() => draft$.get().length, { key: 'length' })`, or `query$(select, load, { key: 'user' })`. This replaces positional authored keys; `signal$('draft')` always stores the string. Uncompiled declarations need an explicit nonempty key. Existing `sync` and `kind` options share that trailing options object.

Module declarations resolve to request-local cells on the server and document-local cells in the browser. Declarations inside a compiler-identified stable feature instance resolve to that instance instead. Independent roots in one document therefore see the same module state without sharing state across requests or documents. Retiring an instance fences its work; unmounting one root does not retire document-global state.

The explicit `createScope` surface remains available for manually managed data lifetimes:

```ts
import { createScope } from 'octane/signals';

const account = createScope({ scopeKey: 'account:42' });
const count$ = account.signal$('count', 0);
const doubled$ = account.derived$('doubled', () => count$.get() * 2);

account.batch(() => {
	count$.set(2);
	console.log(doubled$.get()); // 4, immediately
	count$.set((previous) => previous + 1);
});

const stop = doubled$.subscribe(() => console.log(doubled$.get()));
// subscribe does not deliver an initial notification.
count$.set(4);
stop();

// Retire this data owner when the account/session actually ends.
account.dispose();
```

`scope.asyncSignal$` is removed. Import `createResource(scope, key, describe)` for
an eager resource with an explicit owner, or use the normal owner-optional
`query$` declaration. Query construction is selected statically by these callers;
an application importing only synchronous scope behavior does not retain query
producers. There is no replacement compatibility method or runtime installation.

Keys are nonempty strings, unique within one scope. Two scopes with the same textual `scopeKey` still own separate state. A handle can read itself, or its owning scope can read it with `scope.get(handle$)`; a different scope cannot impersonate that owner. Derived computations may read handles belonging to another scope without taking ownership of them.

Writes use `Object.is` equality and become visible immediately. Nested batches defer notifications until the outer synchronous batch ends. `scope.action(fn)` preserves `this`, arguments, and the return value while applying that same batching rule. It does not untrack reads, roll back earlier writes on an exception, or keep a batch open across `await`.

An explicit renderer `startTransition` or `useTransition` Action is different from `scope.action`: native setters stage a private candidate. Committed reads, public subscriptions, and affected DOM bindings keep their previous values while the candidate's actual presentation reads are pending. Acceptance publishes the graph and prepared presentations together; `isPending` remains true until that work finishes. A boundary's configured timeout may show its fallback without publishing private signal values. Ordinary urgent edits remain immediate, and a newer same-cell transition supersedes older intent; functional updates retain their chronological order.

Async Action setters join the renderer's existing in-flight Action batch, including function-valued form actions. Delegated user events and `flushSync` retain urgent behavior. The private read context is synchronous: it is not installed globally across `await`. Functional setters evaluate against their candidate, while ordinary reads outside a synchronous candidate context continue to observe committed state. `scope.action` alone does not import or install a renderer scheduler.

Transition support currently covers live local writable, derived, and query producers, including local streams after their first value. Receiver-owned server streams and historical adoption frames are not yet admitted as transition candidates; those paths fail explicitly rather than mutating live state speculatively. They remain qualification work for the complete streaming transition contract.

The legacy `scope.derived$` callback remains synchronous. Facade `derived$` adds Promise and stream attempts. Derived evaluation, updater callbacks, selectors, native rendering, and historical adoption reject signal writes. Untracking a loader does not remove this separate write guard. Plain values can be objects, but deep mutation is not tracked; replace a value to publish a change.

Explicit scopes own their producers independently of UI consumers. Unmounting one component removes its native subscriptions; it does not destroy shared resources used by another component. `dispose()` is idempotent and revokes requests, closes streams, releases dependency links and historical leases, and clears retained values. Surviving handles then throw `ScopeDisposedError`. Public subscriptions end silently on disposal.

## Server-owned HTML without a client renderer

An envelope-owning host can emit `earlySignalBootstrapScript({ nonce })` from
`octane/server` before exposing bound controls or streamed results, then pass
`earlySignalBootstrap: 'external'` to its fragment renderers to avoid duplicate
scripts. This inline script captures input/results without importing modules.
Live derivations and async behavior additionally require the renderer-free
signal engine; include that delivery in the eager byte budget.

Before importing modules that read document signals, call
`bootstrapStreamedSignalResults({ buildId, documentId, initialSignals })` from
`octane/hydration/streamed-signals`. `initialSignals` is the initial response's
native manifest, not a later cached HTML frame. It initializes unread document
state once; early user edits take precedence. Late or duplicate initial state
installation throws rather than rewinding live state. Native component roots,
if added later, use the returned `signalOwner`; none is required for behavior.
`installSignalDocumentLifecycle` accepts `readIdentity` for a host-owned identity
carrier; a null, changed or throwing identity read fails closed on persisted
restore. Deliberately custom `signalOwner` objects stay explicit and require
`runWithSignalOwner` around their behavior callbacks.

This result-only bootstrap accepts signal results without shipping Octane's DOM
region-placement implementation. Use the existing `bootstrapStreamedSignalHydration`
instead when the host calls `receiver.registerRegion` to let Octane place streamed
HTML. Both use the same document ownership, validation, bounded delivery and
lifecycle rules; choose one bootstrap per document. The result-only receiver
validates placement frames and their order but never applies their HTML.

For an existing server-owned control, bind its property without reconciliation:

```ts
import { bindSignalControl } from 'octane/signals';
import { draft$ } from './state';

const stop = bindSignalControl(document.querySelector('textarea')!, 'value', draft$);
// Dispose before replacing the node. For an accepted hydration handoff, offer
// this cleanup in controlLeases instead of calling it early.
// stop();
```

`value` supports text inputs, textareas and selects; `checked` supports checkbox/radio inputs.
Writable handles adopt captured early edits and receive native writeback.
Compiled writable controls require [matching server/client builds](./ssr.md#quick-start),
including controls nested inside conditional fragments or keyed lists.
Readonly handles only project their value; neither mode sets HTML `readOnly`.
The host retains structural ownership. No synthetic input, form-reset manager,
radio-group manager or renderer root is installed. Initial pending/error reads
throw and release the adapter's resources. Retain and call the returned cleanup.

The cleanup remains callable and also carries an explicit handoff capability.
A fixed textarea presentation using `value={unbound(draft$)}` can pass it in
`hydrateRoot`'s `controlLeases`, alongside its `bindingLeases`. A suspended or
declined attempt leaves the early owner active; only an accepted matching
takeover retires it. See [presentation handoff](./deferred-hydration.md#optional-handoff-to-normal-hydration)
for the supported shape and ownership requirements.

Use the same bundled engine instance for early and later consumers. Loading an
independently bundled second copy is not a state handoff. For synchronous native
actions, load the responsible controller early; deferred replay cannot recreate
expired transient user activation.

## Async resources, retries, and streams

Prefer `query$` for new keyed sources. A selector result of `skip` produces an idle snapshot and does not start the loader. `undefined` is still a valid selected key. `refetch()` keeps a usable same-selection result visible with `refreshing: true`; `reset()` deliberately returns strict reads to pending presentation. Loaders receive the prior ready value as optional `previous` and a fresh attempt `AbortSignal`.

```ts
import { createResource, createScope, query } from 'octane/signals';

const account = createScope({ scopeKey: 'account:42' });
const selectedId$ = account.signal$('selected-id', 1);

const userQuery = query('user', async (id: number, { signal }) => {
	const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`, { signal });
	if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`User request failed: ${response.status}`);
	return response.json() as Promise<{ id: number; name: string }>;
});

const user$ = createResource(account, 'user', () => userQuery(selectedId$.get()));
const card$ = account.derived$('card', () => ({
	id: selectedId$.get(),
	name: user$.get().name,
}));

selectedId$.set(2);
const previousCard = card$.latest(null);
user$.retry(); // Quiet refresh if the selected request still has a usable value.
user$.retry({ pending: true }); // Strict reads suspend until the new result.
```

The description runs eagerly and tracks its synchronous reads. The loader, including its synchronous prefix, is untracked. Equivalent canonical query arguments share an in-flight request within one data scope. Retrying a shared entry retries it for all selectors of that entry. Distinct owners do not share requests. Incompatible loader definitions under the same query key are rejected.

Every attempt has a revocable publishing lease. An obsolete resolve, rejection, stream yield, or completion cannot publish after selection changes, retry, or disposal, even if the producer ignores cancellation. Entries are removed when no resource selects them; there is no idle cache of every historical request key.

Cancellation callbacks are untracked producer code. If abort or iterator cleanup retires the scope, the canceled caller cannot start replacement work. If cleanup retries synchronously, that nested attempt keeps its lease even if its loader immediately fails.

Request arguments and serialized values accept undefined, null, booleans, finite numbers, strings, dense arrays, and acyclic plain objects with enumerable string data properties. Object keys are canonicalized; undefined and negative zero remain distinct. Accessors, symbols, custom prototypes, sparse arrays, cycles, and nonfinite numbers are rejected. Request arguments are copied and frozen before loading, so mutating the caller's object cannot change an in-flight identity.

A stream query uses `query(key, loader, { kind: 'stream' })`, where the loader returns an async iterable or a promise of one. Before its first yield the resource is pending and connecting. A yield makes it ready and open; normal completion keeps the last value and marks it closed and complete. Completing without any yield is an error. Cancellation requests both abort and iterator closure. Iterator factory, `next()`, and result-accessor failures become resource errors.

Renderer integrations attach an already-validated early result channel with `attachStreamedSignalResult(receiver, owner, identity)`. The adapter binds the exact document, instance, node, selection generation, and attempt before attaching. Frames or a receiver failure may arrive before the query module evaluates; they remain bounded by the receiver and settle the later local query without starting a duplicate browser request. A changed selection, attempt, or retired owner rejects the channel instead of reviving it. This is renderer infrastructure, not an application data-loading API.

## Optimistic actions

`optimistic$(source$)` layers operation-owned tentative values over a writable or query source. A write must belong to `action$`; the first write pins the exact owner, current `requestKey`, and concrete selection generation, so changing selection cannot move an overlay to another record or resurrect it after an A→B→A transition.

```ts
import { action$, optimistic$ } from 'octane/signals';

const visibleUser$ = optimistic$(user$, {
	compareAuthority: (incoming, current) => incoming.revision - current.revision,
});
const save = action$('user.save', async (operation, name: string) => {
	const id = user$.get().id;
	visibleUser$.set((user) => ({ ...user, name }));
	try {
		const authoritative = await updateUser({
			id,
			name,
			operationId: operation.id,
		});
		operation.adopt(authoritative);
	} catch (error) {
		if (mayHaveReachedServer(error)) return operation.uncertain();
		throw error;
	}
});
```

The action's synchronous prefix is batched. After `await`, opaque helpers use `operation.set(visibleUser$, update)` because ambient operation state is deliberately not carried across arbitrary async code. A definitive rejection removes only that operation's overlay. `operation.adopt(value)` updates only the still-matching pinned source selection; it cannot overwrite a later selection. `operation.until(read, { timeout })` observes pinned authority with its own overlay excluded.

For concurrent server writes, configure `compareAuthority(incoming, current)` before dispatch. It must be pure and return a finite number: positive means strictly newer; zero or negative settles the successful operation and removes only its overlay without replacing authority. Comparison uses the current source value, not an optimistic overlay. Thus receipts for revisions 2 then 1 leave authority at revision 2 while both operations settle. Operation IDs and client request order do not establish server freshness.

Handles for the same owner/source share that policy. Omitted options reuse an existing comparator; a different explicit comparator function is a configuration error. Without a comparator, adoption retains arrival-order behavior for unversioned/local uses and cannot guarantee monotonic server revisions. Independently fetched or streamed authority still needs its own freshness policy; this option governs action receipts, not every source update.

An action only receives the arguments supplied when it is invoked. If its handler is deferred, snapshot the command's inputs in an eager handler and pass them through [behavior capture](./deferred-hydration.md#capturing-command-input-before-deferred-work). Live input handoff preserves the newest editor state, not each earlier Save's payload. A captured submission must not reread the latest draft or rewind the editor when it runs.

`operation.uncertain()` returns an identifiable `{ status: 'uncertain', operationId }` receipt and keeps the overlay for explicit reconciliation. A thrown transport error with code `OCTANE_RPC_UNCERTAIN` is wrapped as `ActionUncertainError` with the operation ID and original cause. Neither path retries a mutation. Use `isActionUncertain(value)` to distinguish both forms. The operation ID is ordinary serializable input for an application server call; the transport does not invent durable idempotency or receipt storage.

Retain the operation if the application needs in-memory reconciliation after an uncertain response. Once an authorized receipt lookup establishes the outcome, call that operation's `adopt(authoritativeValue)` or `reject()`. Adoption still requires the original live owner and exact selection; rejection removes only that operation's overlay, including after supersession. Confirmed and rejected operations are terminal. `until` rejects on selection supersession or retirement, and stops when the operation receives a definitive response; another record's data cannot confirm the old write. This does not persist operations across reloads or perform the receipt lookup automatically.

## Availability and retained values

| Read                                   | Contract                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `handle$.get()` / `scope.get(handle$)` | Return the current ready value, throw its pending thenable, idle error, or source error.                                          |
| `handle$.latest(fallback)`             | Return the whole last successful computation, or the fallback if none exists. This result need not have appeared in committed UI. |
| `handle$.snapshot()`                   | Return an immutable idle, pending, ready, or error record. Ready records have `value`; error records have `error`.                |
| `scope.isPending(() => handle$.get())` | Catch pending thenables and return a boolean; other errors still throw.                                                           |

Snapshots also expose `refreshing`, `connection`, `complete`, and an optional request identity. Undefined, null, false, and empty strings are usable values, not pending sentinels. A stream can be ready while its producer is incomplete. Ready derived snapshots aggregate activity from their dependencies.

An async `derived$` attempt may use its context's `read(handle$)` for a dependency discovered after `await`. Changing any attempt dependency revokes publication, aborts the attempt signal, closes an active iterator, and starts a new attempt. A producer that ignores abort still cannot publish an obsolete resolution, rejection, yield, or completion. A Promise that resolves to an async iterable is unwrapped before any value is published.

`latest` retains one complete _calculation result_, not an arbitrary mixture of old and new fields. Keep the identity and commands that belong to that result in the same projection. For example, a retained card for item 1 must not carry item 2's delete command while item 2 loads. A successfully calculated object can be retained while one of its next inputs is pending. Ordinary errors preserve that last result, but `latest` never hides a retired owner or an incompatible/released historical frame. Resource retry and UI error-boundary reset remain separate operations.

Live retained results remain valid only while every contributing data owner is alive, including owners reached through nested derived reads. Retiring an originating owner invalidates the result even after a new pending branch stops reading that owner. It also wakes pending consumers so retirement cannot leave a view waiting forever. Equal replacement values still replace their ownership provenance. Serialization rejects a retained value whose live origin has retired, including during reentrant cancellation callbacks.

`isPending` asks whether its authored expression can produce a value. `scope.isPending(() => resource$.get())` returns true while that strict read suspends; `scope.isPending(() => resource$.latest('loading'))` returns false when the fallback or retained value succeeds. It does not convert ordinary errors into pending. Use snapshots to inspect background refresh or stream activity.

## TSRX components and existing hooks

Native JSX attributes and individual object-style properties accept signal handles. Reusable types such as `CSSProperties`, `HTMLAttributes`, `SVGProps`, `ComponentProps`, and `JSX` imported from `octane` keep their scalar value types, so components can read and calculate with those values. Components that accept handles must declare that capability explicitly with `SignalHandle<T>`, or use the binding-aware `JSX.IntrinsicElements` types from `octane/jsx-runtime` when forwarding host props.

A writable signal passed directly to a textarea's `value` accepts native edits
without rewriting the textarea's reset baseline when the published value already
matches the live value. This preserves native Undo/Redo grouping. A different
programmatic value updates both the live value and reset baseline. Scalar values,
sampled values, and read-only signal handles retain ordinary controlled-value
mirroring; source-ordered spreads use the winning `value` source.

`useSignal$` is available from `octane/signals/client`; server compilation selects `octane/signals/server`. It uses the existing compiler-assigned hook slot and the real component scope's cleanup:

```tsrx
import { useMemo } from 'octane';
import { useSignal$ } from 'octane/signals/client';

export function Counter() @{
	const count$ = useSignal$(0);
	const label = useMemo(() => String(count$.get()));
	<button onClick={() => count$.set((value) => value + 1)}>{label as string}</button>
}
```

When a component receives its signal reader through props and has no signal API binding to import, import the signals module for its native-read compilation:

```tsrx
import { useMemo } from 'octane';
import 'octane/signals';

export function Reader(props: { read$: () => string }) @{
	const value = useMemo(() => props.read$());
	<output>{value as string}</output>
}
```

The import must be a runtime import; `import type` does not enable native reads.

Native reads use Octane's existing component scopes, blocks, scheduling, and acceptance machinery. The compiler carries read evidence through its own memoization and deferred values. A stable signal handle alone is not evidence that its value is unchanged. Committed subscriptions remain alive until replacement work is accepted, and discarded work releases its provisional subscriptions.

Signal-consuming renderer modules activate a versioned private runtime capability before rendering. The runtime then collects reads around the actual component invocation, before parameter defaults and destructuring execute. Setup reads also remain tracked when a function returns an intermediate JSX variable or an explicit `createElement` result. Compiler body brackets join that same invocation; they do not create a second subscription owner. Compile native consumers and their custom hooks through the standard Octane toolchain so inferred memo caches carry native read evidence.

Use `$` for signal bindings and functions that return native signals or hide live native reads. In a module with a runtime signals import, compiler naming diagnostics recognize the branded API and statically known native-capability aliases and helpers. Optional TypeScript name validation is separate and can diagnose imported signal types without enabling native reads. Neither check renames old bindings or ordinary properties merely because they end in `$`. Opaque imported functions can exceed static naming analysis; compiler-owned caches must still preserve reads observed at runtime.

An inferred memo tracks its lexical dependencies and the native reads made while computing its result. A cache hit replays that read evidence so the component remains subscribed:

```ts
const formatted = useMemo(() => formatCount(count$.get()));
```

For an explicit dependency array, sample values during rendering:

```ts
const count = count$.get();
const formatted = useMemo(() => formatCount(count), [count]);
useEffect(() => recordCount(count), [count]);
```

Known native reads hidden inside a `useMemo` callback with fixed dependencies are diagnosed; `[count$]` observes the stable handle, not its changing value. The explicit `null` dependency form remains the existing every-render escape. Effects and event callbacks read imperatively and do not create render subscriptions. Explicit arrays are never rewritten. Imported aliases, namespace calls, and plain custom-hook modules use the same inferred memo contract.

Naming diagnostics and hook-slot assignment are separate analyses. Native hook-slot recognition follows direct named imports, including import aliases ending in `$`, and non-computed namespace calls. Further local aliases introduced by `const` assignments or namespace destructuring are not canonicalized as native hook sites.

The handle remains stable for that hook lifetime. Letting it escape does not transfer ownership; it is unusable after its component scope is retired. Conditional hooks follow Octane's existing call-site slot rules; plain JavaScript loop hooks remain invalid. Server-local signals end with their render pass and do not enter shared-state seeds.

Local `useDerived$` and local async hooks are not part of the API. A local derived facade alone cannot keep captured props isolated through speculative renders, transitive graph caches, and memoized children. Mutating the committed computation early would expose speculative state. Use `scope.derived$` for explicitly owned computations; local closure staging is outside this API.

### Signal-valued styles

DOM `style` accepts native signal handles as property values, using the actual CSS
property names:

```tsrx
import { useSignal$ } from 'octane/signals/client';

export function Position(props) @{
	const left$ = useSignal$(0);
	const right$ = useSignal$(0);
	<div style={{ ...props.style, left: left$, right: right$ }} />
}
```

For a direct template style, signal changes update the style binding without
rerunning component setup. The binding uses the normal scheduler, CSS value
rules, Suspense, and hydration. Numeric lengths receive `px`; unitless values,
custom properties, `!important`, and property removal retain their normal behavior.
You can also pass a signal containing an entire style object, CSS string, or `null`.
Unmounting releases subscriptions without disposing shared signals.

Use `SignalCSSProperties` from `octane` for types that accept signal-valued CSS
properties. `CSSProperties` describes ordinary CSS values for compatibility with
libraries that consume them. The `$` naming rule still applies to signal bindings
and ordinary JavaScript object fields; inline DOM style keys use CSS names.

Hosts with JSX prop spreads or duplicate attributes, and stored return-JSX
elements, retain their existing render scopes and source-order resolution. Their
styles also accept signals, but may rerun that broader scope. Explicit `.get()`
reads continue to subscribe the scope that executes them. Other DOM attributes
continue to use explicit reads.

### Stored element compatibility

The primary native component path remains compiled `@{}` TSRX. Ordinary `return <…>` syntax inside a `.tsrx` file is also supported, with different stored-value behavior and measured costs.

Stored JSX resolves its dynamic element record and children in the represented render scope. Inspecting its `type`, `props`, or children outside rendering does not freeze those reads for later rendering. The compiler uses the existing descriptor path for ordinary return-JSX functions in both client and server modes; `@{}` bodies keep their compiled template path. Returned subtrees containing compiler-only syntax, such as document-head metadata and template directives, retain their compiled fragment descriptor while deferring its read expressions. Their inspection exposes that fragment's existing descriptor ABI, not an ordinary host record. This distinction has a runtime cost and is measured separately from engine costs.

Styled native returned fragments use an inspectable `Fragment` descriptor, including static and empty fragments. This lets server styles enter the current request when a stored fragment renders. Unstyled static fragments retain their positional-array representation. Styles are not queued globally for a later, unrelated server render.

## Server rendering and historical adoption

For streaming pages, read queries inside separate `@try`/`@pending`/`@catch`
boundaries. The server sends the page shell with placeholders first, then the
first ready HTML for each boundary. Later yields from a stream query travel as
data; an active view or binding displays them. Each yield is the whole next
value, not an instruction to append HTML or array items.

The standard fullstack host connects this result delivery automatically. A
custom host opts in with the renderer's `streamedSignals` option and installs
the browser bridge before importing signal consumers. See the
[SSR setup and examples](./ssr.md#stream-data-with-signals).

Use request-local data scopes on the server. Native completed reads produce a versioned, tagged seed manifest, including the exact read channel: strict value, retained `latest`, or ready snapshot. Equal textual scope keys in one presented graph must identify the same owner. A retained result keeps the query identity that produced it, not the current pending selection's arguments.

Client adoption reads immutable historical frames while live state continues independently. It never rewinds a live writable value or populates a live derived cache with an older result. Root, delayed-island, and streamed-segment adoption own separate leases, released after accepted layout work. A matching completed resource seed avoids a duplicate client load. An incomplete ready seed alone starts a new quiet client attempt; with a matching streamed-result channel, the client joins the existing server attempt and receives its later values. The server producer itself stays on the server.

The engine also exposes `scope.serialize()` and `scope.beginAdoption(seed)` for explicit embedding. A frame's synchronous `run(read)` installs that owner's historical view, `retain()` acquires another independent lease, and `release()` ends one lease. Nested reads of other shared owners require their frames too. Releasing a frame affects presentation validity, not live data.

A serialized seed is an explicit copy of data, not a live cross-owner reference. Its decoded historical values belong to the adopting owner and its frame leases. The wire format does not transport another process's live ownership identities; retiring an original owner does not retroactively erase a seed that was already copied.

Pending producers and error objects are not transported. Native pending/catch arms that cannot be seeded are marked for fresh rendering within their owned hydration range. An unexpected missing native channel triggers hydration recovery rather than becoming an application error or silently combining historical and live reads. Completed output that directly samples a pending/error snapshot, or converts pending demand into an `isPending` result, is unsupported by the ready-state transport and receives a diagnostic. Use a pending boundary or a serializable `latest` projection instead.

## Inspection and current limits

`scope.inspect()` returns metadata about nodes, dependencies, subscriptions, request activity, adoption leases, and retirement. It does not evaluate dormant computations or include values and callbacks. Tracing is off by default; `createScope({ scopeKey, debug: { traceLimit: 256 } })` enables a bounded metadata-only trace.

DevTools can inspect native reads when profiling is enabled. Historical performance measurements are in the [implementation evidence](experimental-scoped-signals-evidence.md). Scoped ownership, async coordination, and retained values have costs beyond raw Alien Signals; engine measurements alone do not establish browser rendering speed.

The supported native rendering targets are the DOM client and server. Deep stores, mutation journals, cross-root atomic reveal, cross-realm handoff, and native reads in non-DOM hosts are outside this API.
