# Deferred hydration

> [!NOTE]
> Deferred hydration is experimental. Its API and compiler protocol may change
> while Octane is in beta.

`<Hydrate>` keeps useful server-rendered HTML visible while delaying the work
that makes a subtree interactive. It is intended for initial-page content that
can be read, styled, and indexed immediately but does not need to run component
code or attach events immediately.

```tsrx
import { Hydrate } from 'octane';
import { visible } from 'octane/hydration';

export function ProductPage() @{
	<main>
		<ProductHero />
		<Hydrate when={visible({ rootMargin: '400px' })}>
			<Reviews />
		</Hydrate>
	</main>
}
```

The server still renders `Reviews`. During initial hydration, Octane adopts the
boundary's persistent `<div>` but leaves the existing child DOM dormant. When
the boundary becomes visible, Octane loads its generated child chunk, hydrates
the preserved DOM in place, and then enables refs, effects, and events.

Deferred hydration applies only when matching server HTML exists in the initial
document. A boundary first mounted after the app is running renders normally on
the client.

## The activation decisions

Every boundary makes these performance decisions:

| Prop | Default | Controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `when` | required | When preserved server HTML becomes interactive. |
| `split` | `true` | Whether the compiler moves the children into a generated JavaScript chunk. |
| `independent` | `false` | Require standalone activation without evaluating or hydrating the lexical parent. |
| `prefetch` | none | Whether code or other resources begin loading before `when` resolves. |

The complete component surface is:

| Prop | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `when` | `HydrationStrategy \| (() => HydrationStrategy)` | Required hydration trigger. The function form runs only on the client and must return synchronously. |
| `split` | `boolean` | Compiler-split the direct children into a deferred chunk. Defaults to `true`. |
| `independent` | `boolean` | Require a compiler-proven standalone widget. Unsupported ownership or captures fail compilation instead of falling back. |
| `prefetch` | `HydrationPrefetchStrategy \| HydrationPrefetchFunction` | Start loading the split chunk or run custom preparation before hydration. |
| `fallback` | renderable | Client-only loading UI for a later client mount or suspension. |
| `onHydrated` | `() => void` | Called once after the child successfully commits on the client. |
| `children` | renderable | The subtree rendered on the server and deferred on the client. |

`HydrateOptions` is exported from `octane/hydration` for reusable option objects:

```tsrx
import { Hydrate } from 'octane';
import { interaction, type HydrateOptions } from 'octane/hydration';

const deferredEditor = {
	when: interaction({ events: ['focusin', 'click'] }),
	split: true,
} satisfies HydrateOptions;

<Hydrate {...deferredEditor}>
	<RecommendationEditor />
</Hydrate>
```

### `when`

Import strategies from `octane/hydration`:

```tsrx
import { Hydrate } from 'octane';
import { interaction, visible } from 'octane/hydration';

export function Recommendations() @{
	<Hydrate when={visible()}>
		<RecommendationList />
	</Hydrate>

	<Hydrate when={interaction({ events: ['focusin', 'click'] })}>
		<RecommendationEditor />
	</Hydrate>
}
```

A function form can make the decision from browser-only information. Octane
does not evaluate this function on the server, and it must return a strategy
synchronously on the client.

```tsrx
<Hydrate
	when={() =>
		window.matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)').matches
			? interaction({ events: 'click' })
			: visible()
	}
>
	<Recommendations />
</Hydrate>
```

Available strategies:

| Strategy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `load()` | Hydrates with the initial app hydration. |
| `idle({ timeout? })` | Uses `requestIdleCallback`, with a 2,000 ms default timeout fallback. |
| `visible({ rootMargin?, threshold? })` | Uses `IntersectionObserver`; the default margin is `600px`. |
| `media(query)` | Hydrates when the media query matches. |
| `interaction({ events? })` | Hydrates on interaction intent and replays the triggering event. |
| `condition(booleanOrGetter)` | Hydrates once the condition is truthy. |
| `never()` | Keeps initial server HTML permanently static. |

`interaction()` listens for `pointerenter`, `focusin`, `pointerdown`,
`touchstart`, `touchend`, `beforeinput`, `input`, `compositionstart`,
`compositionupdate`, `compositionend`, and `click` by default. Supported custom
events also include `auxclick`, `contextmenu`, `dblclick`, `keydown`, `keyup`,
`mousedown`, `mouseenter`, `mouseover`, `mouseup`, `pointerover`, and
`pointerup`.

#### Capture interactions before `hydrateRoot()`

An immediate `hydrateRoot()` call needs no extra setup: mounting the first
`Hydrate` boundary installs interaction capture as a synchronous fallback. If
your client entry awaits route discovery, data, or dynamic imports before it
calls `hydrateRoot()`, install the lightweight capture queue before that work so
an interaction during the gap can be replayed:

```ts
import { hydrateRoot } from 'octane';
import { initializeHydrationEventCapture } from 'octane/hydration';

initializeHydrationEventCapture();

await prepareClient();
hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('app')!, App);
```

Calling `initializeHydrationEventCapture()` more than once is safe; Octane
installs the listeners only once per document.

Hydration is one-way: after `condition()` becomes true and the boundary
hydrates, making it false again does not return the subtree to a dormant state.

### `split`

Splitting is enabled by default:

```tsrx
<Hydrate when={visible()}>
	<HeavyReviewsWidget />
</Hydrate>
```

This defers both component execution and the child JavaScript. Set the literal
`split={false}` when the code is already required elsewhere or when a separate
chunk would not be worthwhile:

```tsrx
<Hydrate when={idle()} split={false}>
	<SmallBadge />
</Hydrate>
```

The compiler recognizes `Hydrate` imported from `octane`, including an import
alias. Split children must be authored directly inside the boundary. Extraction
rejects function-as-children, hook calls directly inside the extracted JSX, and
`this` or `super` captures; move that work into a child component or opt out
with `split={false}`. Ordinary lexical values can be captured by the generated
child component.

A scoped `<style>` whose whole lexical style scope sits inside the split child
compiles (plan S8.5). The scope is the children list the block is written in:
its sibling blocks and the host elements they stamp. Both the server compile and
the extracted child keep the authored-position hash, so hydration adopts the
server classes. A scope that straddles the boundary — blocks or stamped host
elements on both sides — is still a compile error (`OCTANE_HYDRATE_SPLIT_STYLE`).
Keep that scope entirely inside the boundary, move it entirely outside, extract
a child component, or set `split={false}`. A `<style>` nested in a function
never joined the enclosing scopes and may move with the split child.

Generated Hydrate chunks are not eagerly module-preloaded. Lazy-module discovery
for independently suspended siblings never enters a dormant Hydrate boundary,
so its child code remains deferred until activation or an explicit prefetch
strategy. The Vite and Rsbuild app integrations still link CSS reachable from a
route's deferred chunks, including its layout and configured root fallbacks,
because that route's server HTML needs its styling before the child JavaScript
loads. This eager CSS collection follows the composed route's asset graphs; it
does not turn deferred JavaScript into an eager dependency.

### `independent`

`independent` is an explicit, strict request for a standalone widget entry:

```tsrx
<Hydrate independent when={interaction()}>
	<TodoComposer city={city} />
</Hydrate>
```

The compiler and bundler must preserve serializable captures, stable IDs and
hook seeds, the matching server read frame, and every reachable stylesheet. If
the child depends on parent-owned runtime state such as a ref initialized by a
parent effect, compilation fails with a source-located diagnostic. It does not
silently change to parent-first hydration. Lexical nesting alone is not a
dependency: a local callback that closes only over a shared signal can remain
eligible after compiler lifting.

Ordinary `<Hydrate>` boundaries, including the default split form, retain the
existing parent-first activation behavior.

#### Replaceable selections versus commands

Independent widgets normally preserve every captured interaction in order. A
widget can explicitly mark a replaceable selection with a nonempty
`data-octane-hydrate-selection` group on native `type="button"` buttons:

```tsrx
<Hydrate independent when={interaction({ events: 'click' })}>
	<button type="button" data-octane-hydrate-selection="forecast-day"
		onClick={() => selectedDay$.set('Monday')}>Monday</button>
	<button type="button" data-octane-hydrate-selection="forecast-day"
		onClick={() => selectedDay$.set('Tuesday')}>Tuesday</button>
	<button type="button" onClick={sendForecast}>Send</button>
</Hydrate>
```

Before activation, consecutive plain primary clicks in the same group and the
same independent boundary keep only the latest click. For example,
Monday → Tuesday → Send → Monday → Tuesday replays Tuesday → Send → Tuesday.
A different group or another widget's captured action is also an ordering
barrier. Groups do not merge across boundaries. This applies before bootstrap
and while the widget's code is loading; once active, native events run normally.

The marker asserts that replacing earlier clicks is safe. Do not put it on
commands such as Send, Add, or Purchase; Octane does not inspect arbitrary event
closures to infer this distinction. Modified clicks, non-primary clicks,
submit/reset buttons, links, and input events do not coalesce. Use the explicit
click-only strategy shown above: default `interaction()` also captures pointer,
focus, and input events, which remain ordering barriers. Independent native
links keep their native navigation instead of being queued for replay.

Capture preserves the original target, boundary, and selection group. Replaced
or stale controls are not redirected to equivalent-looking DOM. This opt-in
does not evaluate a handler before its code arrives, promise immediate visual
selection feedback, or recreate trusted browser user activation.

### `prefetch`

A strategy-form prefetch loads the generated child chunk early without making
the boundary interactive. It accepts `load()`, `idle()`, `visible()`, `media()`,
or `interaction()`; `condition()`, `never()`, and function-form strategies are
activation-only.

```tsrx
import { idle, interaction } from 'octane/hydration';

<Hydrate when={interaction()} prefetch={idle()}>
	<ProductRecommendations />
</Hydrate>
```

Strategy prefetching requires splitting, so TypeScript rejects it with
`split={false}`. A procedural prefetch can also prepare data and works with
either split mode:

```tsrx
<Hydrate
	when={visible()}
	prefetch={async ({ preload, signal }) => {
		await preload();
		await warmReviews({ signal });
	}}
>
	<Reviews />
</Hydrate>
```

The procedural context contains:

- `preload()`, which loads the generated child chunk or resolves immediately
  with `split={false}`;
- `waitFor(strategy)`, which accepts the same five prefetch strategies and
  resolves with `'prefetch'`, `'hydrate'`, or `'abort'`;
- `signal`, an `AbortSignal` for cancelable work; and
- `element`, the persistent boundary `<div>`.

An awaited procedural-prefetch promise blocks hydration if `when` resolves
first. Fire-and-forget work does not.

## Fallbacks and completion

`fallback` is client-only loading UI for a boundary that first mounts after the
app is running and then suspends on its child chunk or child data. It does not
replace initial server HTML while a boundary waits for its strategy or while
that initial boundary first suspends during activation.

```tsrx
<Hydrate when={visible()} fallback={<ReviewsSkeleton />}>
	<Reviews />
</Hydrate>
```

To keep client-only fallback code out of SSR, the compiler removes a direct
`fallback` attribute, an inline object-spread fallback, and a statically
resolvable single-use `const` spread from the server output. Shared or dynamic
spread objects are left intact because rewriting them could change observable
JavaScript behavior; keep their fallback values safe to evaluate on the server.

`onHydrated` runs once after the child successfully commits on the client,
whether the boundary adopts preserved server DOM or mounts client-only.

The exact direct-import form `<Hydrate split={false} when={never()}>` is a
server-only static range. The compiler removes its descendants from the client
render and prunes private module-scope declarations and imports reachable
exclusively from that range. SSR emits the children without a host wrapper, and
hydration reserves their ID positions without evaluating or reconciling them. A
client-only mount has no server range to preserve, so this exact form renders no
children. The tag must have exactly those two attributes; additional attributes,
spreads, indirect `Hydrate`/`never` values, and every other strategy retain the
ordinary runtime boundary semantics. Shared, exported, and coupled declarations
remain in the client module so the optimization cannot change unrelated module
behavior.

When a descendant module is reachable only through a pruned static declaration
chain, it is absent from the client manifest; a CSS file imported only by that
module is absent too. Import ordinary stylesheets from an eager route/layout
module. Scoped `<style>` remains safe: the client compiler retains a directly
authored style long enough to preserve the hash of the sibling scope it sits in
(the children list that holds the block)
(so the elements around the boundary keep the same class chain), while SSR
collects the style scopes owned by removed descendant components and emits them
with the rendered static content.

For streamed static content, a synchronous unhandled server error still reaches
the nearest authored server catch (or the stream's fatal path). If a pending
fallback has already flushed, a later rejection or abort terminalizes that
server-owned range and retains the fallback; it cannot request client recovery
because its client graph does not exist.

## Behavior-only roots and external ownership

A permanently static boundary intentionally never installs its descendant
component handlers: its client component graph does not exist. When another
system owns that markup, attach independent behavior through `octane/behavior`
instead of hydrating or rendering the externally managed range:

```ts
import { attachBehaviorRoot } from 'octane/behavior';
import { articleStream } from './article-stream.js';

const lifetime = new AbortController();
const root = attachBehaviorRoot(document.querySelector('#app')!, {
	signal: lifetime.signal,
});
const streamOwner = Symbol('article stream');

root.registerExternalRange(document.querySelector('#article')!, {
	owner: streamOwner,
	ready: articleStream.allReady,
});

let activateAnnotation: (event: Event, element: Element) => void;
let observeAnnotation: (element: Element, signal: AbortSignal) => () => void;

root.registerBehavior({
	id: 'article-annotations',
	owner: streamOwner,
	target: '[data-annotation]',
	events: ['click'],
	ready: import('./annotations.js').then((module) => {
		activateAnnotation = module.activateAnnotation;
		observeAnnotation = module.observeAnnotation;
	}),
	adopt(element, { signal }) {
		return observeAnnotation(element, signal);
	},
	handleEvent(event, element) {
		activateAnnotation(event, element);
	},
});

await root.ready;

// Aborts pending work, disconnects observers/listeners, and runs every
// adoption cleanup exactly once. Existing DOM is preserved by default.
root.dispose();
```

`attachBehaviorRoot` neither renders nor hydrates its container. Existing DOM,
attributes, and externally streamed updates retain their identity; a single
root-scoped observer discovers later matching elements and releases behavior
when elements leave the container. Importing the focused `octane/behavior`
entry does not load the component runtime, compiler, or server renderer. The
same API and public types are also exported by `octane`.

### Compiled presentation on existing DOM

For a fixed native element tree, `adoptBindings` from `octane/behavior` can
replace a manual attribute/class presentation callback without creating a
component root. This experimental path is explicit: mark a named component
with `'use dom bindings'` and activate it from an Octane-compiled `.tsrx` or
`.tsx` module. The ordinary component remains usable by the server renderer.

```tsrx
// PrimaryAction.tsrx
import { unbound } from 'octane/behavior';

export interface PrimaryActionProps {
	type: 'button' | 'submit';
	disabled: boolean;
	label: string;
	showSend: boolean;
	showStop: boolean;
	initiallyHidden: boolean;
}

export function PrimaryAction(props: PrimaryActionProps) @{
	'use dom bindings';
	<button
		type={props.type}
		disabled={props.disabled}
		aria-label={props.label}
		hidden={unbound(props.initiallyHidden)}
	>
		<span hidden={!props.showSend}>
			<svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
				<path d="M8 2 2 8h4v6h4V8h4Z" />
			</svg>
		</span>
		<span hidden={!props.showStop}>
			<svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
				<path d="M3 3h10v10H3Z" />
			</svg>
		</span>
	</button>
}
```

```ts
// activate-primary-action.tsrx — compiled even though it contains no JSX.
import { adoptBindings, type BindingSource } from 'octane/behavior';
import { PrimaryAction, type PrimaryActionProps } from './PrimaryAction.tsrx';

export function activatePrimaryAction(
	root: Element,
	source: BindingSource<PrimaryActionProps>,
	signal: AbortSignal,
) {
	return adoptBindings(root, PrimaryAction, source, { signal });
}
```

`BindingSource` supplies `getSnapshot()` and `subscribe(notify)`. It can be an
existing owned signal projection or external store; adoption does not create a
second reactive graph. Each notification reads one snapshot and prepares all
bound values before synchronously writing them. The handle's `refresh()` also
publishes synchronously, including when the enclosing signal batch has not yet
delivered subscriptions. Use it before a native operation such as
`form.requestSubmit()` that immediately depends on updated button properties.

The compiler selects a separate binding artifact; authors keep normal typed
component imports. Do not import generated query modules by hand. A direct call
from an uncompiled plain `.ts` file throws; import a compiled activation function
instead. Keep that activation module free of ordinary rendered-component uses
if its browser graph must exclude the renderer.

With `octane()` followed by `@octanejs/stylex/vite`, production browser builds can share eligible co-located StyleX recipes between the normal component and its extracted binding artifact. Definitions stay local while StyleX performs its normal optimizations; only the resulting closed, immutable recipe data and required helpers move to generated shared modules. CSS remains in the existing stylesheet. Development/HMR, server compilation, and unsupported or escaping definitions retain their existing path. Authors do not need to export a separate styles module.

Custom compiler adapters can use `stylexBindingConstants` from `@octanejs/stylex/compiler`. Pass the matching Octane result's optional `bindingConstants` metadata to this Babel plugin, placed **after** the StyleX plugin, and pass the prior Octane source map as `inputSourceMap`. Register each `{ id, code, map }` returned in `metadata.octaneStylexSharedConstants` as a build-owned virtual module. Preserve the canonical authored filename, honor development/server exclusions, and use the metadata from that exact compilation; do not reconstruct it from emitted JavaScript. This is build-time integration, not a browser runtime dependency. Measure the early-only and combined delivery graphs separately: sharing can reduce their combined cost while increasing the early-only cost.

Import the named view directly from its defining module, not through a barrel.
Keep that leaf module free of eager state initialization. Imported projection
helpers must be pure; pass live values through the source snapshot rather than
reading ambient state inside a projection. Snapshots must be synchronous values,
never promises or other thenables.

Pure projections also accept the canonical `isSignalHandle` import from `octane/signals` and unshadowed `String` and `Math.min` calls. Local `const` event and ref callbacks may be named or aliased in setup; their bodies execute as native adapters, not while preparing presentation values. They cannot be used as eager projections. Named refs preserve dependency-based attachment, but a ref that captures another local callback is unsupported. An explicit component `ref` may forward a ref supplied through props; this does not authorize arbitrary component-prop spreads.

Compiler-proven presentation supports native HTML/SVG, text, native events and
refs, direct signal bindings, conditions, keyed lists, and supported pure child
composition. Hooks, arbitrary component logic, unsupported spreads, and raw
HTML produce a diagnostic, not a renderer fallback. Structural programs own
only their declared regions; fixed programs update properties without replacing
nodes.

Declare scalar text explicitly when its type is not evident in the template: `<span>{message$ as string}</span>` keeps a string-valued signal directly bound, while `<span>{(status?.message ?? '') as string}</span>` marks an ordinary string projection. The type checker checks the signal's value for this text intent; it does not require an application-side read or a cast through `unknown`. Keep shared control labels in typed label props rather than opaque renderable child slots when the view needs primitive-text handoff.

Binding views may use flat destructured props, including aliases, primitive literal defaults, and a final rest binding: `function Action({ label: text = 'Send', ...props }) @{ ... }`. Destructuring runs once for each prepared snapshot, so projections and event handlers share the same captured values and rest object. Defaults apply only to `undefined`, not `null`. Nested or computed patterns and nonliteral defaults fail extraction. A rendered `children` slot may be aliased or read through rest when it was not excluded; a non-null default for that slot is unsupported. A rest binding does not authorize an arbitrary native JSX spread: the existing spread restrictions still apply.

For a child binding view called with explicit props, the compiler can specialize a native spread of that child's destructured rest parameter to the caller's known prop names. Authors keep normal component imports and JSX; the ordered prop-shape request is compiler-owned. This does not permit arbitrary object spreads, aliases of rest, conflicting native writers, or unsupported property channels. A generic `adoptBindings` call on a rest-spreading component without a proven caller shape still fails clearly. Normal SSR keeps the authored spread and shares its structural and class-group annotation allocation with the extracted view; it does not acquire the extracted artifact's narrower prop API.

When an eligible view returns only another view, `adoptBindings(element, View, source)` can resolve its enclosing compiler-owned range from the existing native element. Resolution follows only adjacent, single-content view/root wrappers and requires one exact `View` match; it does not search DOM ancestors, skip siblings, or cross conditional, slot, or list boundaries. Views with multiple root nodes still require an explicit range. Adopt the enclosing view whose explicit child props establish a closed spread shape, not the generic rest-spreading child itself.

Pass the exact element emitted by the matching server build. Adoption validates
template compatibility, native topology, and conflicting binding ownership
before modifying it. Only declared dynamic properties and structural regions
are owned; unrelated properties and existing event listeners remain
with their current owner. An application must stop previous manual writers for
the channels it hands over. Template compatibility is not document or request
authorization: retain the enclosing application's lifetime and stream fencing.

`unbound(value)` marks an explicitly external-owned attribute in an opted-in
view. The ordinary component uses its value during SSR and normal rendering;
the adopter neither evaluates nor writes that attribute. Above, the server can
initially hide the button while an existing visibility controller retains ownership
of `button.hidden`. This is not signal untracking or a delayed write.

Call `dispose()` or abort the supplied signal to unsubscribe and release the
binding claims. Both retain existing DOM. Compose this with a behavior root's
adoption callback when discovery, externally streamed ranges, or automatic
element-removal cleanup is needed; the small binding runtime does not require
that machinery itself.

Each external range belongs to its declared `owner`. Strictly nested ranges are
allowed, and the closest registered range determines ownership for behaviors
with an `owner` constraint. Registering the same element for another owner
throws unless `{ replace: true }` explicitly hands the range to its new owner;
handoff aborts the displaced range and invalidates stale asynchronous work.
An already-canceled replacement never evicts a healthy existing owner.
Ranges must belong to the root's document and container. Their optional `ready`
promise delays adoption without preventing the external owner from updating
markup. Individual ranges and behavior registrations expose their cancellation
signal, readiness, and an idempotent `dispose()` method.

Named behaviors may list already registered `dependencies` and incompatible
`conflicts`. Registration fails for unknown dependencies, duplicate IDs, or an
active conflict. Adoption waits for dependencies, the entry's optional `ready`
promise, and its closest external range. Root readiness reflects the active
registrations and ranges at the instant `root.ready` is read.

Delegated `events` begin listening immediately. If an interaction arrives
before its target is adopted, `handleEvent` later receives the exact original
same-document `Event`, including its genuine `isTrusted` value. Octane does not
redispatch the event, synthesize trust, repeat native link or form activation,
or restore transient user activation that expired during asynchronous loading.
Code requiring transient activation must run synchronously while the original
event is being dispatched.

### Optional handoff to normal hydration

An adopted compiler-proven native view can keep handling interactions while its enclosing
application waits to hydrate. Pass its `BindingHandle` to the later root:

```ts
// In the explicitly loaded renderer entry, not the early activation module.
import { hydrateRoot } from 'octane';
import { App } from './App.tsrx';

const root = hydrateRoot(container, App, props, {
	bindingLeases: [earlyBinding],
});
```

Use matching server/client compiler output and the same signal engine and
application state for both entries. If the application supplies a `signalOwner`,
retain that same owner during hydration. Loading the early binding artifact does
not load the renderer; explicitly loading this later entry does. Signal writes
and early handlers do not request hydration on their own.

The early binding remains active while hydration suspends or an attempt is
discarded. Only an accepted attempt transfers ownership: it prepares current
values, retires early listeners and subscriptions without restoring old
presentation, and publishes normal bindings before refs. A command already
handled by the early listener is not delivered again to its replacement.
Signals remain alive. Replacing or unmounting the owning root releases pending
leases; aborting a hydration attempt alone does not.

Refs retain their per-owner lifetimes: accepted takeover detaches the early ref
and attaches the normal ref to the same node. A discarded or suspended attempt
does neither. Node identity is preserved; suppressing the detach/attach pair for
an identical callback is not part of the contract.

This handoff is narrower than renderer-free presentation generally. Fixed native
views can transfer attributes, events, refs, and supported native style
projections. Structural views additionally require proof of the current native
nodes, selected conditional branches, child views, slots, and primitive text.
The renderer validates that proof again before publishing, including after a
suspended or staged attempt. A stale attempt cannot overwrite a newer early
presentation.

An opted-in component with one native host can transfer its declared class,
style, `data-*`, `aria-*`, and `tabIndex` bindings while leaving its children
outside that lease. Reserved `data-octane-*` protocol fields do not qualify.
Known-provider spreads retain their exact declared fields:

```tsrx
import type { OctaneNode } from 'octane';
import { unbound } from 'octane/behavior';

export function ComposerFrame(props: {
	recovery: boolean;
	iosViewport: boolean;
	children: OctaneNode;
}) @{
	'use dom bindings';
	<form
		class={props.recovery ? 'recovery' : 'ready'}
		data-ios-viewport={props.iosViewport ? '' : undefined}
		tabIndex={props.iosViewport ? -1 : undefined}
	>
		{unbound(props.children)}
	</form>
}
```

Adopt the existing form with `adoptBindings` and offer that returned handle in
`bindingLeases`. The early artifact neither evaluates nor owns these children.
Normal hydration still renders them in the same application tree; independently
bound textarea controls and deferred children keep their own ownership. Other
host properties can remain outside this lease through `unbound`.

This parent-only proof currently requires a named `props` parameter and no local
setup declarations. Inline pure expressions, signal `.get()` reads, and imported
pure projections retain that scalar shape. Destructured parameters or local
`const` declarations select the general binding program, which supports those
forms but cannot transfer a parent with opaque children. This is a handoff
capability limit, not a restriction on renderer-free authoring generally.

The compiler must prove the single host and its owned presentation fields.
Hydration checks that exact host and source before publishing, and closes the
host's preparation before entering its children. A child update alone does not
invalidate a host lease. Moving or replacing the host, conflicting ownership,
or a stale source cannot authorize takeover. Suspension or refusal leaves the
early layout live; accepted transfer preserves its current owned fields until
the normal host bindings publish before refs. Nullable attributes are removed
using their normal DOM semantics; `tabIndex` uses its canonical `tabindex`
attribute without changing descendant control ownership.

If retirement cleanup invalidates the host after acceptance, its successor
writers and pending host refs are revoked. This does not roll back cleanup or
retire independently owned children. A later explicit root render against that
invalid host refuses before writing or attaching its ref, then follows the
renderer’s normal error handling and root teardown.

An unused generic-content branch does not
prevent takeover of a supported slot branch, but switching into unsupported
content while takeover is pending causes a clear refusal. A native rest spread
also requires the same compiler-proven caller prop shape; proof from another
instance or call site cannot authorize it.

An externally bound textarea value can transfer alongside a fixed presentation.
Keep `value={unbound(draft$)}` in the authored view and explicitly offer the
callable cleanup returned by `bindSignalControl`:

```ts
const control = bindSignalControl(textarea, 'value', draft$);
// Later, in the renderer entry, using the same textarea, handle and signal owner:
const root = hydrateRoot(container, Composer, props, {
	bindingLeases: [earlyBinding],
	controlLeases: [control],
});
```

Do not call `control()` before hydration. Preparation leaves both early owners
active; accepted publication retires the offered control and installs its direct
signal successor before refs. The textarea, draft, selection and active
composition survive takeover. A later call to the old cleanup cannot dispose the
successor. Normal controlled-value semantics apply after takeover, including an
explicit changed model value winning during composition.

The successor's value subscription is prepared before either early owner
retires. If acquiring it fails, the early presentation and control remain
usable and hydration reports the error. Retirement cleanup must not dispose
the shared signal owner: doing so intentionally ends that data's lifetime,
rather than transferring it to hydration. Cleanup must also leave the textarea
in its accepted position. If it moves or replaces the node, hydration reports
the invalid transfer and releases every prepared value successor in that
presentation, including controls published before the failure. Later renders
cannot reclaim those revoked channels; independent controls can bind them.
Retirement has already begun at that point; it does not roll back user cleanup
or revive the retired early presentation.

This path requires a writable string signal, the same concrete handle and data
owner, and compiler-proven textarea value content without authored children.
Disposed, already-claimed, foreign or unoffered control ownership fails closed.
Known-provider style spreads such as `unbound(stylex.attrs(sx))` can use their
existing closed-field compiler contract; arbitrary spreads remain unsupported.
No control lease or renderer is needed for a textarea that stays renderer-free.

Other writable controls and unsupported normal-renderer writers do not
qualify for handoff. Ownership of entered keyed-list, opaque, or generic
renderable regions also remains outside the handoff contract; a host-only lease
does not authorize transfer of its descendants.
Unsupported handoffs fail explicitly while preserving the early presentation;
they do not silently replace its DOM or load a different renderer path. Keep
richer renderer-free programs under their existing owner until an explicit
replacement strategy is available.

### Capturing command input before deferred work

Retaining an event does not snapshot other controls or signals. A Save queued
while a module loads must not later read whichever draft happens to be current.
Use an eagerly registered `captureEvent` to produce a detached immutable payload:

```ts
const behavior = import('./save-behavior');
root.registerBehavior({
	target: form,
	events: ['submit'],
	ready: behavior,
	captureEvent(event, element) {
		event.preventDefault();
		const fields = new FormData(element as HTMLFormElement);
		return Object.freeze({
			id: String(fields.get('selectedId')),
			text: String(fields.get('draft')),
		});
	},
	adopt() {},
	handleEvent(_event, _element, _context, payload) {
		void behavior.then(({ save }) => save(payload));
	},
});
```

Here `form` is an existing server-owned form and `root` its behavior root; the
Save button submits that form. Capture runs synchronously during each matching
native event, before readiness or adoption can delay delivery. The return type
is inferred for the fourth `handleEvent` argument. The queued payload is retained
once, in FIFO order, under the same target/owner lifetime as the event; replacement
or disposal invalidates it. Octane does not clone or freeze arbitrary values for
you: copy the primitive fields you need, not live DOM, mutable signal objects, or
a shared object that later edits can change.

With that policy, A → Save → B → Save delivers A and B while the editor stays B;
A → Save → clear delivers A and leaves the editor empty. The handler passes the
payload to `action$`, which still validates the selected owner/base before writing.
Live control adoption remains independent and always keeps the latest user edit.

The capture registration must be running before these commands are offered. It
cannot reconstruct commands captured earlier by the default inline bootstrap.
Neither this hook nor deferred delivery restores transient activation; cancellation
such as `preventDefault()` must happen in the actual early capture handler.

Root identity is scoped to its document and container. A second root for the
same live container requires `{ replace: true }`, which disposes the old root
without removing markup; creating a root for a replacement document never adopts
listeners or ranges from its predecessor. Disposing an independently owned
nested root immediately restores eligible behavior belonging to its surviving
ancestor root. Pass `{ preserveDOM: false }` to `root.dispose()` only when the
root should explicitly clear its container.

## Correctness and nesting

### Later-fetched SSR regions

A custom host can send separately fetched SSR through the same bounded renderer
frame transport. `createStreamedRegionPlacementFrame` from `octane/server`
packages a completed `renderToString` result with its exact historical signal
owner, selection identity, content revision, scoped CSS, and completed-build
stylesheet URLs. It rejects missing or mismatched owners, multiple data owners,
and document-head metadata. It does not authorize requests or rebind cached HTML;
cache authorized source data and render a new request-specific envelope.

On the client, register the selected identity and dormant range with
`createStreamedRegionReceiver`, then consume the response with
`readStreamedRendererResponse` from `octane/hydration`. Result decoding uses the
matching `decodeSignalValue` codec. The region's historical-frame callback
establishes adoption separately from newer live data. When activating, mark the
range active, retire only its receiver-owned outer anchors, and hydrate the
original component HTML. Later placement is rejected for that active range;
the renderer alone reconciles subsequent model updates.

The [conversation-history fixture](../packages/vite-plugin-octane/tests/_fixtures/app/src/conversation-history/)
demonstrates this integration, cached/fresh responses, stable-key updates,
completed-page cursors, and independent document-owned drafts. Custom fetches
and explicit owners must also participate in document retirement/freeze handling;
installing the document lifecycle helper does not automatically cancel an
application's unrelated transport.

### Persisted document navigation

The app integrations install document lifecycle handling when SSR emits a signal
mailbox or the completed client build declares independent hydration support.
On a persisted `pagehide`, pending query/derived reads and not-yet-entered island
activation are fenced. Active island DOM, completed results (including results
buffered before a descriptor executes), and writable drafts are retained.

On a persisted `pageshow`, the integration checks the executing build ID, the
document ID in `#__octane_data`, and the original owner lifetime. Compatible
restoration starts only still-selected unfinished reads under fresh attempts;
the old document stream remains closed. It does not resubmit accepted mutations:
uncertain optimistic operations still require explicit reconciliation. A
mismatched identity retires the owner and reloads; ordinary non-persisted exit
retires the owner and disposes independent roots.

This is document/build revalidation, not an account authorization service or a
deployment-version lookup. Hosts still own account changes and subsequent server
authorization. Client-only signal routes with neither SSR signal mailboxes nor
independent capability do not automatically load this integration. A custom host
can explicitly call `installSignalDocumentLifecycle` from
`octane/hydration/streamed-signals`, providing the same build/document metadata,
document owner, and optional stream/island lifecycle handles.

Browsers decide whether to preserve a page at all. A new document after history
navigation follows normal SSR/hydration; restored form values alone do not prove
BFCache restoration.

### Boundary ownership

Deferred hydration is a performance hint. An update outside a dormant boundary
may open it early when Octane must reconcile the child to avoid stale server
HTML. `never()` is the exception: its initial server subtree remains static.

Treat `when` as boundary configuration rather than a strategy state machine. If
the intended meaning of a boundary changes, give `Hydrate` a new `key` to start
a fresh lifecycle. Octane still reads a current direct strategy prop while the
boundary is dormant: changing it to `never()` tears down an older installed
trigger so a stale idle, visibility, or interaction callback cannot bypass the
static-HTML exception.

Nested boundaries hydrate parent-first. Interaction intent can wake an
unresolved ancestor chain, after which Octane replays a same-type event for the
target boundary. A `never()` ancestor keeps every deferred descendant inert.
Replay preserves supported platform event classes and their captured keyboard,
pointer, mouse, touch, input, composition, and focus data where the browser can
construct that event. A replayed event is still programmatic: it cannot restore
the original event's trusted status or expired transient user activation.

If activation races a pending renderer-owned streamed Suspense reveal, the
boundary waits for that reveal or its client-render degradation before adopting
the range. Pending reveals inside an independently dormant nested `Hydrate`
boundary remain owned by that nested boundary and do not delay its ancestor.

Ordinary `Hydrate` boundaries render a persistent HTML `<div>`. Account for that
wrapper in layout and HTML nesting; direct placement inside SVG or MathML is
unsupported because an HTML parser moves a `<div>` out of foreign content before
hydration. The exact permanent-static form described above is wrapper-free and
inherits its HTML, SVG, or MathML parser namespace.

For the proposed next step—omitting an inert page shell while independently
hydrating its live islands—see [Static shells and independently hydrated islands](./hydration-islands-plan.md).
That design is not a shipped hydration mode.
