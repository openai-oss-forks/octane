# RFC: Async Signals Across Streaming SSR and Hydration in Octane

## Motivation

A server-rendered page should be useful before all of its JavaScript arrives.
People should be able to type into a form, choose an item, and keep that state
when a widget activates. Independent results should appear as they become ready,
without restarting server work in the browser or overwriting newer user input.

This RFC connects Octane's signals, streaming SSR, and deferred hydration around
that contract. It supports both native Octane rendering and hosts that keep
ownership of their HTML.

Historical status: the design was updated September 15, 2026 after core-team feedback. The text below records the [PR #1069 work](https://github.com/octanejs/octane/pull/1069) and later acceptance discussions; it is not a current release inventory. The
[implementation guide and acceptance checklist](./async-signals-implementation.md)
distinguish implemented APIs from remaining work. The longer host examples below
are design sketches, not a list of published exports. For executable examples,
start with [signals](./signals.md), [deferred hydration](./deferred-hydration.md),
or the [conversation benchmark](../benchmarks/conversation-streaming/README.md).
Trusted Types integration and enforcement tests remain out of scope.

## Accepted author model

- `signal$(initial)` is writable state, including function-valued data.
  `derived$(compute)` is read-only sync, Promise, or async-iterable computation.
  `query$(select, load)` is a read-only keyed source. No writable-derived
  override behavior is introduced. Existing scoped/hook APIs remain compatible
  except the legacy `scope.asyncSignal$` method: explicit-owner callers use the
  imported `createResource(scope, key, describe)` factory instead. This keeps
  query producers out of query-free owner dependencies; normal authors still
  use `query$` without creating a scope.
- `createScope` is optional. Global/module declarations are valid; server cells
  are request-isolated, browser cells are document-owned, and local declarations
  have stable instance identity. The compiler supplies serializable IDs.
  Explicit keys and host prepare/adopt integrations below are optional.
- Direct `value={draft$}` uses branded writable capability for native two-way
  binding. Read-only handles and `value={draft$.get()}` are one-way, without
  setting HTML `readOnly`. Text, attributes, and per-property styles (including
  spreads) subscribe directly; custom component props retain handles.
- Pre-flush capture records early native edits and their revisions, including
  clear. The renderer-free signal engine adopts initial state and those edits
  before behavior code reads them. Once that engine is running, listeners update
  live cells and derivations immediately; the inline capture alone cannot run
  derivations. Delayed SSR/storage candidates cannot overwrite newer edits.
  Handoff must preserve the original control and its editing state without a
  duplicate write; native IME coverage remains an acceptance requirement.
- Explicit independent activation fails with a targeted diagnostic if extraction
  cannot preserve ownership/captures. Lexical nesting alone is not a dependency;
  a parent-created lifecycle resource is. Ordinary parent-first hydration stays.
- Replaceable selection intents retain the latest selection. Distinct actions retain their own immutable event-time inputs and deliver once each unless explicitly deduplicated. Capturing a command payload requires an eager handler; the default input mailbox only preserves the latest editor state. Immediate feedback requires a proven descriptor/eager handler; queued events cannot restore user activation.
- Server-owned HTML with behavior-only activation is a first-class target.
  Global signals, initial SSR values, async/streamed results, early controls, and
  document lifetime must work without importing or starting the client renderer.
  `createScope` is optional here too; a native island is a separate opt-in.

### Renderer-free hosts and early delivery

A server-owned HTML host can keep its existing shell, streamed regions,
and ordinary browser controllers. Adopting this RFC must not require converting
those regions into reconciled roots, importing `octane/internal/client`, or
fetching the full runtime through a shared bootstrap chunk. A signals-only export
passing tree-shaking is insufficient: test the **compiled author module**, actual
split production graph, and fetched/evaluated assets before and after activation.

The early path has two deliberately separate costs:

- `earlySignalBootstrapScript({ nonce })` from `octane/server` emits the branch's
  inline input/result capture without importing any client module. An envelope
  owner places it before exposing bound controls or result frames and passes
  `earlySignalBootstrap: 'external'` to its fragment renderers to omit duplicates.
  Passing `independentHydration: true` to `earlySignalBootstrapScript` additionally captures independent-island intent.
  The host remains responsible for arranging that parser order and CSP policy.
- Live `get`, `set`, subscriptions, derivations, and async computations require
  the renderer-free signal engine. A host needing synchronous reactive behavior
  before an island or interaction delivers that engine and the required small
  handler early. The tiny capture script alone is **not** a complete reactive
  runtime. Report both byte costs and the time each becomes usable. All later
  consumers must share the same engine/owner, not separately bundled copies.
  Uncompiled host computations use the explicit attempt-bound `read(handle)` continuation after `await`; raw `get()` there has no implicit dependency tracking or compiler diagnostics. The [continuation contract](#core-and-signals-work) applies to hosts as well as compiled views.

Before evaluating behavior modules that read state, the host upgrades the early
mailboxes with `bootstrapStreamedSignalResults` from
`octane/hydration/streamed-signals`, supplying its build/document identity and the
initial response's `initialSignals` manifest. This does not require app-core's
private document envelope or `hydrateRoot`. Initial document seeds initialize
unread live state once; a conflicting or late installation fails clearly. Early
user edits win over those seeds. Instance read frames and later cached/streamed
historical frames remain presentation evidence, never unconditional live writes.

Hosts that also delegate streamed DOM placement to Octane keep using
`bootstrapStreamedSignalHydration` and its `receiver.registerRegion` API. The
result-only entry uses the same authority and delivery implementation without
retaining DOM placement; it is a static host choice, not a second initialization
phase or a runtime capability loader. Install only one of these document bridges.

For server-owned native controls, `bindSignalControl(control, 'value', draft$)`
joins the same writable cell without reconciling its HTML; `checked` and readonly
handles follow their capability. This is an optional host adapter, not a new
author state model: templates still use `value={draft$}`. The adapter's cleanup
ends its property/listener ownership before a host replaces that range or an
optional native island takes ownership. Controllers and behavior roots may be
installed early; deferring their code does not magically provide synchronous
navigation cancellation or trusted user activation.

The first fixed-native-presentation slice introduced a compiler-backed path through
[`adoptBindings`](./deferred-hydration.md#compiled-presentation-on-existing-dom).
An opted-in static view projected one owned snapshot onto matching existing SSR
elements without retaining the renderer. That slice handed over only declared
dynamic properties, leaving event, structure, and document lifetime ownership
with the application. It excluded structural rendering and direct writable
`value`/`checked` authoring. Neither presentation bindings nor the control adapter
above introduce a new signal graph or replace stream-result authority.

The first integration did **not** deliver the intended migration to canonical
authored presentation. Manual DOM operations, HTML builders, class/attribute
writers, marker readback, observers, and reconciliation maps remained throughout
the host. Successful resource adoption and smaller native cleanups do not close
that omission. The fixed-element binding slice above was an implementation limit,
not the desired endpoint of this RFC.

The current local candidate extends `adoptBindings` and adds `mountBindings` for
compiler-proven text, `@if`, keyed `@for`, pure child views, and authored JSX
slots. Direct native `value`/`checked` bindings select the same control adapter
automatically: writable handles receive native edits, read-only handles project
one-way, and `.get()` or ordinary values remain sampled. Owned `checked` bindings
require a fixed checkbox or radio input type. Radio synchronization covers native
input on bound group members; entirely unbound members and programmatic writes
do not acquire implicit sibling-signal authority. Source-faithful consumer
deletion, application budgets, and current-head CI remain integration gates.
Sampled numeric values use native control coercion; nullish samples leave the control uncontrolled. This does not broaden the string/boolean contracts of writable control handles.

The required contract uses one authored view for SSR and live presentation. It must adopt
real native elements and explicitly owned attribute, class-token, and style
channels while leaving unowned descendants opaque. It must support a wrapper
with both owned controls and externally managed siblings, not merely an empty
element or an artificial replacement root. Keyed adoption must identify the
historical server rows even when live state advanced before activation.

Projection analysis remains conservative. Under the directive's immutable-props
contract, selected native string reads can compose, including
`(props.account?.name.trim() || props.identifier).slice(0, 1).toUpperCase()`.
Every call must satisfy the projection boundary; an `as string` cast does not
admit arbitrary methods, computed calls, or mutation. A view that hits an
extraction diagnostic is not a completed authored migration, and replacing it
with an imperative repaint is not a fix.

Completion requires deleting the replaced presentation machinery in real
consumers. A shared imperative HTML builder, a signal effect calling an old
repaint routine, or a resource-only migration does not meet that requirement.
Native measurement, focus, composition, form serialization, and external range
ownership remain legitimate adapters; each retained imperative presentation path
must have an explicit owner and reason. Do not remove a readback observer until
every producer publishes the required state synchronously. These capabilities
must preserve early controls and streaming authority without pulling the general
client renderer into a renderer-free route or silently increasing its budget.
Compiled renderer-free attribute writes preserve Octane's existing URL-sink sanitization, including rejection of unsafe `javascript:` navigation URLs. This is not a general sanitizer for raw HTML, CSS, or external host writers.

Fine-grained native bindings should reuse the existing signal graph. A direct
signal-valued class or fixed CSS property subscribes to that handle and updates
only its owned channel; it must not rerun the entire presentation snapshot on
each unrelated signal notification. Runtime Symbol identity is authoritative,
not a variable's `$` suffix. Within renderer-free `BindingSource` projections,
an explicit `.get()` remains a sampled value; the surrounding source publication
or explicit refresh samples it again. Ordinary renderer-backed native-read mode
still observes `.get()` through its native read frame. Replacing a
handle, retiring a keyed row, and aborting the view must release its subscription
without retiring the shared document state.

The landed native signal-style implementation is canonical for style-object
reading and renderer-backed native style updates. This work should extend that
implementation with the required request and instance ownership, not maintain a
parallel style engine. Renderer-free views retain only their compiler-proven
channel writes and adoption/cleanup lifetimes; sharing style behavior must not
import the general renderer or its scheduled blocks into that path.

Renderer-free styles now also accept whole style objects, object spreads, nested
property handles, and whole `SignalCSSProperties` handles. The optional whole-style
capability uses the canonical native style reader; it owns only subscription,
adoption, and native-write lifetimes. Fixed-property artifacts retain their
smaller scalar path. Neither style nor control capability imports the renderer
or creates a second signal graph, and each is omitted when the compiled view
does not need it.

Style adapters may supply an exact imported-factory contract through
`knownAttributeSpreads`. This is a trusted adapter declaration matched by module,
import, and member binding, not purity or shape inferred from a function's name.
The compiler evaluates the declared pure factory once and projects only its
declared stable own data fields; conflicting fixed ownership is rejected. It
does not interpret arbitrary attribute factories. The default `style` field is serialized CSS text, as returned by `stylex.attrs()`. A contract with `style: 'object'` instead selects the existing signal-aware whole-style capability, as needed by `stylex.props()`:

```ts
knownAttributeSpreads: [{
  source: '@octanejs/stylex',
  imported: '*',
  members: ['props'],
  fields: ['className', 'style', 'data-style-src'],
  style: 'object',
}]
```

The source and import must match the actual author module; a named import uses its own contract. StyleX development output can include `data-style-src`, so the contract retains that diagnostic attribute alongside class and style. Prefer the adapter's supplied contracts rather than duplicating this list. Omitted style-object support preserves the smaller CSS-text path. For StyleX, class and style come from one ordered merge, preserving property precedence. The adapter must not expand one authored call into three independent
calls, and fine-grained subscriptions must not split conflicting style variants
into independently concatenated class tokens. Dynamic style functions remain
ordinary signal derivations; the integration must not create a parallel state
graph. Compiler work, initial subscriptions, emitted bytes, and update work are
all part of the performance accounting.

This channel support does not make every StyleX dynamic function signal-aware. A passthrough such as `stylex.props(styles.dy(scale$))`, where `dy` returns `{ scale }`, can retain a non-null CSS-ready handle and update its variable without rerunning the merge. StyleX's numeric-unit conversion, arithmetic on arguments, and null-dependent class selection still expect primitive values. A nullable handle is not itself null: removing its CSS variable cannot reproduce StyleX's class precedence. Use explicit primitive reads inside a shared derivation for those cases, and derive the class and style fields from that shared result. This preserves StyleX's existing types and semantics with one merge per result change; automatic lifting of arbitrary dynamic functions and their types is not part of this compiler contract.

Whole-style notifications still read and diff the style object. This is not a fixed-variable, constant-work compiler optimization. Native graph identity and cleanup remain shared with ordinary style bindings, and consumers that do not select object-style spreads acquire no new runtime dependency.

Within the explicit pure-projection contract, an immutable imported-factory configuration may expose checked expression-bodied dynamic functions, such as `styles.position(inlineStart, blockStart)`. The compiler verifies the exact static member and its expression rather than trusting a method name. Imported immutable string tokens may also use the supported native string operations, including computed CSS property names. Ordered attribute merging still runs once per source projection; this acceptance does not turn a sampled `.get()` projection into a fine-grained derived subscription.

Known attribute spreads currently own the entire declared class/style attribute; they do not create managed class contributions alongside an external writer. For an intentionally external static root, `...unbound(stylex.attrs(...))` preserves its SSR attributes without adopting those channels. It must precede nonoverlapping owned attributes, does not update reactively, and does not count as migrating the retained external presentation work.

Dynamic contributions can instead feed one authoritative ordered `stylex.attrs(...)` composition in a derived snapshot. Bind its explicit `class` and `style` fields through one retained view; optional producers publish their original StyleX values or `null`, rather than disposing that view. All changing class/style contributors must participate in this composition. This whole-source path reruns the projection and merge; it is not target-only signal delivery. Independently adopted overlapping StyleX owners would need a separate contribution contract. Manual restoration or repeated attribute-factory calls are not substitutes.

Integration should replace the host's bespoke state carrier, early-control
handoff, and stream receiver where these primitives cover the same responsibility,
not mirror state through old and new stores. Storage keys, draft recovery policy,
authentication, cache freshness, URL actions, and accepted server-operation
receipts stay application-owned. A never-hydrated transcript may remain opaque
server HTML plus compact control/cursor state; it need not serialize its entire
body merely to manufacture an unused component hydration frame.

## Conversation switching, cache, and server work

`currentConversation$` and per-conversation `draft$` are writable client intent;
`conversation$` is a read-only query and `title$` a read-only derivation.
Switching A to B may immediately display eligible cached B while fetching
progressive SSR HTML/data. Fresh server revisions reconcile by stable item IDs,
without duplicating history or resetting the composer. The host owns cache,
authority, source revisions, and supersession policy.

Title, body, history, and widgets may reveal independently. An already-available
cached title can appear immediately; if an asynchronous cache read is still
pending, the host may show a placeholder instead. Neither choice waits for the
other regions or for a fresh server title. Each result must still belong to the
current conversation and presentation generation and pass the host's freshness
policy. Navigation does not require a global atomic reveal; an explicitly chosen
transition retention policy is a separate contract.

Client selection generation authorizes presentation; server content revision
proves freshness; attempt/sequence orders transport; the historical frame explains
the exact displayed HTML. Arrival order is not freshness. A to B to A creates a
new selection generation. Cached revision-10 HTML uses its revision-10 frame even
if the live graph has advanced to revision 11.

On A to B to A navigation, the application may show cached A immediately and
revalidate or reconnect to newer accepted server work. It must not resubmit the
generation merely because A's view was disposed. Client-owned drafts, selected
map places, and viewport state are keyed by conversation and outlive the visible
widget. A disposed widget may be reconstructed with those values; retaining its
actual native nodes or SDK instance is an optional keepalive policy with a memory
cost, not a continuity guarantee. A fresh read on return is compatible with this
contract. Every visit has a new presentation generation, so frames from the prior
visit cannot mutate the current view without passing the new adoption checks.

Dormant regions retain early input and native focus; validated placement preserves
them. After native activation the renderer alone owns its DOM range; behavior-only
activation leaves the host in charge of structure and claims only explicit
properties/listeners. Data updates need
not re-SSR each yield; neither full reload nor whole-conversation remount is
required. Leaving a view ends its subscription, not accepted server generation.
The host owns completion, timeout, explicit Stop, durable receipts, and reconnect.
Uncertain actions retain their original operation ID and selection, without
automatic duplicate submission.

### Rich, continuously updating conversation

A representative acceptance case interleaves several kinds of work in the same
conversation. A useful title appears immediately and may be revised independently
while visible thinking/progress content, response text, keyed lists, and links
continue changing. A map starts as a placeholder, becomes an interactive widget,
and receives more places during the same stream. Title or map readiness must not
hold back an unrelated text or history update.

The renderer-free path must use the same authored Octane views for the initial
SSR and each subsequent presentation change. Stable map places and list rows
retain their native identity; incoming data does not reset the user's selected
place, map viewport, focus, or editor contents. A map provider's own library may
activate behind an explicitly opaque boundary. Its implementation and asset cost
are separate from Octane's renderer, and neither should load merely because a
placeholder was emitted.

The maintained workload must exercise interleaving, placeholder upgrade, keyed
insertion/update/removal, safe link updates, and independent title revision. It
must also navigate away mid-stream and prove that late results cannot mutate the
new conversation, that widget/view subscriptions are released, and that accepted
server work is not accidentally canceled merely because its view was retired.
Report exact HTML, inline script, CSS, startup, first interaction, widget activation,
and eventual deduplicated asset costs. A deterministic map fixture proves the
Octane contract; it is not evidence about a production map SDK's behavior or size.

## Relation to the original Octane APIs

The design started from the contracts below. “Existing” here describes the
baseline inspected for the RFC, not the implementation status of this branch:

- **Signals:** `createScope`, writable `signal$`, synchronous `derived$`, `asyncSignal$`/keyed `query` resources, `get`/`latest`/`snapshot`, and historical seed leases.
    - **Proposed:** A direct owner-bound author facade, unified sync/async/iterable computed signals, `query$` selection, and attempt-bound reads after `await`.
- **Native reads:** TSRX subscriptions and Strong-mode diagnostics, with explicit scopes for non-renderer hosts.
    - **Proposed:** Proven compiler lowering of asynchronous producer reads, graph interning across islands, and commit/version checks spanning late reads.
- **Deferred hydration:** `<Hydrate>` splits generated client code and captures/replays interactions; `attachBehaviorRoot` attaches behavior to externally owned DOM.
    - **Proposed:** Independently activated SSR widgets whose browser modules/styles remain cold until needed, with a historical read-frame lease per widget.
- **SSR stream:** `renderToReadableStream` emits pending boundaries and accepted HTML, with nonce-aware inline swap scripts and an ordered `injection` source for complete external chunks.
    - **Proposed:** Correlated result frames, early-intent-aware placement, and progressive fetched-region delivery with backpressure and recovery.

The [original signals RFC](https://github.com/octanejs/RFCs/discussions/2) made `createScope({ scopeKey })` explicit because a data producer may outlive a view. That lifetime still matters when two widgets share a query and one unmounts.

- In an Octane document, the request or retained document already supplies an owner. Normal renderer and behavior-only code can declare signals without repeating `scope`. The lower-level engine still exposes `createScope` for deliberately independent lifetimes.
- A boundary leases a historical read frame; it does not necessarily create another data owner. Account transition, document retirement, or an independent feature lifetime retires the relevant owner and work.
- Module-level declarations are valid without an active request. Server reads/writes require the corresponding request owner; there is no process-global mutable fallback. Explicit standalone scopes remain supported.

This RFC adds capabilities beyond that baseline:

- Native reads are enabled through imports from `octane/signals`, `octane/signals/client`, or `octane/signals/server`. The `$` naming convention identifies capabilities but does not itself opt a module in; the old `nativeReads` compiler option is gone.
- Existing derived callbacks are synchronous; `scope.isPending(() => handle$.get())` includes initial suspension; `latest` carries complete-result provenance. The async producer and direct author facade are **additions**, not reinterpretations.
- Compiler support after `await` must preserve Strong-mode read diagnostics, including opaque/imported helpers.

## Proposed author experience

An author declares state, reads, and pending boundaries. A value may be immediately available, arrive from a Promise, or update from an async iterable; consumers use the same `get()` and `snapshot()` contract. A keyed `query$` adds request selection, deduplication, and refetch. An action owns writes and their uncertain acknowledgments. The signal declarations are implemented; the combined host examples remain illustrative. In particular, `renderDocument`, `hydrateIsland`, and the `prepare`/`adopt.input` interface below are design sketches, not current exports. Use the linked guides and maintained fixtures for working integration code.

```typescript
// todos.tsrx — proposed compiler-owned author module.
"use strong";
module server {
  import type { ServerCallContext } from "octane/server";
  import { readTodo, readPreview, saveTodo } from "./store.server";

  export async function getTodo(id: string, context: ServerCallContext) {
    return readTodo(id, { signal: context.signal, viewer: context.viewer });
  }
  export async function getPreview(id: string, context: ServerCallContext) {
    return readPreview(id, { signal: context.signal, viewer: context.viewer });
  }
  export async function updateTodo(input: { id: string; text: string; operationId: string },
    context: ServerCallContext) {
    return saveTodo(input, { viewer: context.viewer }); // Authoritative Todo + revision.
  }
}

import { getTodo, getPreview, updateTodo } from "server";
import { signal$, derived$, query$, optimistic$, action$ } from "octane/signals";
import { isAmbiguousTransportFailure } from "./errors";

export function createTodos(initialId: string) {
  const selectedId$ = signal$(initialId, { key: "selected-id" });
  const draft$ = signal$("", { key: "draft" });
  const todo$ = query$(() => selectedId$.get(), (id: string, { signal }) => getTodo(id, { signal }), { key: "todo" });
  const heading$ = derived$(() => todo$.get().title, { key: "heading" });
  const preview$ = derived$(async ({ signal }) => {
    const id = todo$.get().id;
    const preview = await getPreview(id, { signal });
    return { ...preview, selectedId: selectedId$.get() }; // Tracked after await.
  }, { key: "preview" });
  const visibleTodo$ = optimistic$(todo$, {
    compareAuthority: (incoming, current) => incoming.revision - current.revision,
  });

  const save = action$("todo.save", async (op, { id, text }: Readonly<{ id: string; text: string }>) => {
    const base = todo$.snapshot();
    if (base.status !== "ready" || base.value.id !== id)
      throw new Error("The selected Todo is not ready");
    visibleTodo$.set((todo) => ({ ...todo, title: text }));
    try {
      const authoritative = await updateTodo({ id, text, operationId: op.id });
      op.adopt(authoritative); // Includes selected id and committed revision.
    } catch (error) {
      if (isAmbiguousTransportFailure(error)) return op.uncertain();
      throw error;
    }
  });

  return { selectedId$, draft$, todo$, heading$, preview$, visibleTodo$, save };
}
```

The author API separates writable state from read-only computation:

- **`signal$(initial)`** is writable state; functions are data. Existing setter updater semantics remain: `set(() => fn)` stores a function. **`derived$(compute)`** is read-only and returns `T`, `Promise<T>`, or `AsyncIterable<T>`. Synchronous computation stays immediate, without an unconditional Promise or microtask. Both accept optional trailing `{ key }` options; positional authored keys are not supported. Explicit scope methods retain their fixed `scope.signal$(key, initial)` / `scope.derived$(key, compute)` signatures.
- **`query$(select, load)`**, with optional trailing `{ key }` options, is read-only. Its synchronous tracked selector must succeed before `load(selected, { signal, previous })` starts. Pending or failed upstream reads propagate without starting the downstream loader. A dedicated `skip` sentinel means no selection; `undefined` remains a valid encoded key.
- **Streaming and identity.** A stream loader opts in with `{ kind: "stream" }`, publishes complete yields, then terminates. Keys are stable within a feature instance; canonical argument encoding distinguishes selections. Neither a key nor browser-supplied arguments grant authority.

The compiler does not need to know whether an imported producer is an `async` function. On demand, the general `derived$` path invokes the producer normally and inspects its returned value for a thenable or async iterable; a plain function returning `Promise.resolve(...)` works too. Immediate results stay immediate. Only compiler-proven synchronous computations use the smaller synchronous implementation. There is no `AsyncFunction` constructor test, forced `async` declaration, or eager execution solely to classify producers. Post-`await` dependency tracking remains a separate compiler/explicit-reader contract.

Reads and controls keep their existing strict semantics:

- `get()` returns a ready value, suspends an initial pending read in a rendering boundary, or throws a source error. `snapshot()` reports `idle`, `pending`, `ready`, or `error` status; a `ready` snapshot carries `refreshing` and `complete` flags for quiet refetches and open streams.
- `latest(fallback)` retains one **whole previous successful calculation with its owner and request provenance**, never old fields mixed with new controls. `refetch()` starts a quiet same-selection attempt when a usable result exists; `reset()` deliberately asks for pending presentation. A renderer error-boundary reset is separate.
- The shipped `scope.isPending(() => handle$.get())` reports an initial strict pending read as pending. This proposal preserves that behavior; it does not redefine `isPending` as “only a transition is pending.”

For example, `snapshot()` returns:

- `{ status: "pending" }` before the first value; `{ status: "idle" }` when no key is selected; or `{ status: "error", error }` on failure.
- `{ status: "ready", value, refreshing: true }` during a quiet refetch; `{ status: "ready", value, complete: false }` after a stream yield; and `{ status: "ready", value, complete: true }` after normal completion. A one-shot Promise result is ready and complete.

The ready value exists while a stream remains open. `latest()` may return a previous completed calculation during a changed-key pending state, but strict `get()` still suspends there.

The identities used below are distinct:

- **Owner:** data lifetime tied to a server request or retained browser document.
- **Selection:** query key plus encoded arguments.
- **Attempt:** one revocable execution of that selection.
- **Read frame:** exact values presented by one HTML range. A widget leases its read frame during adoption, independently of current live signal values.

Templates use ordinary pending and error arms; the graph is created under a stable owner, not during a speculative render. The example keeps a native input in the first HTML so typing need not await the widget's JavaScript.

```typescript
// todo-widget.tsrx — server-rendered, independently activated on the browser.
"use strong";
"use octane";
import { createTodos } from "./todos";

export function TodoWidget({ todos }: { todos: ReturnType<typeof createTodos> }) @{
  <section>
    <textarea value={todos.draft$} />
    @try {
      <>
        <h2>{todos.heading$.get()}</h2>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => todos.save({
          id: todos.selectedId$.get(), text: todos.draft$.get(),
        })}>Save</button>
      </>
    } @pending {
      <p role="status">Loading Todo…</p>
    } @catch (error, reset) {
      <button type="button" onClick={() => { todos.todo$.reset(); reset(); }}>
        Retry
      </button>
    }
    @try {
      <p>{todos.preview$.get().summary}</p>
    } @pending {
      <p role="status">Loading preview…</p>
    } @catch (_error) {
      <p>Preview unavailable.</p>
    }
  </section>
}
```

The button above illustrates an already-running handler. If Save is usable before that handler loads, its inputs must instead be captured at the original event and passed to `save(payload)`; deferred replay of a closure reading the current draft is not equivalent. The eager capture contract below covers that case.

The host authorizes a private document **before emitting private bytes**. It creates one graph per request/document owner; the renderer emits a useful frame and streams independently ready regions. The early receiver initializes the live cells before widget code; the widget later joins them. The explicit `prepare`/`adopt.input` example below is an optional host integration, not required normal authoring. Direct bindings generate equivalent descriptors.

```typescript
// Server host.
import { renderDocument } from "octane/server";
import { createTodos } from "./todos";
import { TodoWidget } from "./todo-widget";

export async function handle(request: Request) {
  const viewer = await authorize(request);
  const initialId = validateId(new URL(request.url).searchParams.get("id"));
  return renderDocument(request, {
    prepare: () => ({
      component: TodoWidget,
      instanceKey: "todos.main",
      props: { todos: createTodos(initialId) },
      bootstrap: { initialId }, // Public to this viewer; never a credential.
    }),
    nonce: cspNonce(request),
    headers: privateResponseHeaders(viewer),
  });
}
```

```typescript
// Deferred browser entry for the Todo widget.
import { hydrateIsland } from "octane/client/island";
import { createTodos } from "./todos";
import { TodoWidget } from "./todo-widget";

hydrateIsland("todos.main", {
  prepare: ({ initialId }, adopt) => {
    const todos = createTodos(initialId);
    adopt.input("draft", todos.draft$); // DOM value, revision, caret, IME handoff.
    return { component: TodoWidget, props: { todos } };
  },
});
```

The compiler and receiver split rendering from activation:

- The compiler records a widget's module and style dependencies in a manifest. The server evaluates `TodoWidget` for HTML and marks its SSR range `todos.main`; the browser targets that exact component and range without evaluating the module until activation.
- The tiny document receiver runs before streamed placement. It can record input and discrete intent without importing the widget. It validates instance and bootstrap arguments, interns one graph per document/account/instance/version, and adopts the **presented read frame** for each rendered region. Two islands using `todos.main` share a graph but keep separate presentation leases; a conflicting second bootstrap is an error.
- HTML, serialized model, read frame, and code share a compatible version envelope. Activation is independent: interacting with one widget should not evaluate parent or sibling browser modules merely to attach it.

Direct writable bindings perform an atomic handoff; explicit `adopt.input("draft", todos.draft$)` follows the same contract:

- The server emits a compiler-owned binding identity. Early listeners already publish edits into the live cell. Before queued handlers run, handoff validates current DOM value/revision, installs the full binding, and retires the early listener without a duplicate write. It preserves node, focus, caret, and composition.
- The live draft adopts the latest edit, independently of queued commands. With eager capture, type A → Save → type B → Save submits A then B while the editor stays B; type A → Save → clear submits A while the editor stays empty. Each Save carries detached, immutable draft and selected-item values. Dispatch rechecks its selected authoritative base; a pending or superseded base cannot become an optimistic Todo. Neither replay nor acknowledgement rewinds the editor.

The host sketches above are not copy-and-paste APIs. The contextual server-call
boundary, however, is implemented:

- The compiler removes the trusted final `ServerCallContext` from browser types
  and stubs. The server injects it after authorization. Browser `{ signal }`
  options stay local; they are never serialized credentials.
- In-process SSR calls use the corresponding generated wrapper and trusted
  request context, rather than treating browser-style options as server authority.
- `module server` defines the boundary; there is no new `"use server"` directive.
  Request-body limits and streamed-response budgets are separate. Hosts that do
  not use server functions can supply their own authorized loaders.

See the [implementation map](./async-signals-implementation.md#core-implementation-map)
for the compiler, server adapter, and transport owners.

### A dependent request and safe action entry

Read dependencies are ordinary JavaScript reads. If a second request needs the first result, express the dependency; independent siblings should start without waiting for it.

```typescript
const user$ = query$(() => sessionId$.get(), loadUser, { key: "user" });
const items$ = query$(() => user$.get().id, loadItems, { key: "items" });
const help$ = query$(() => locale$.get(), loadHelp, { key: "help" }); // Independent sibling.
```

A GET URL may prefill a draft with `?q=<text>` or identify an existing receipt with `?operation=<id>`. It must not initiate a mutation. Viewer authorization alone does not establish write intent.

- Accept mutations through authenticated, CSRF-protected POSTs. The host validates input and operation identity before dispatching **once outside speculative rendering**, while unrelated reads may start in parallel. Its CSRF policy must cover the actual credential and request transport.
- After acceptance, the host may redirect to a receipt-only GET URL. Acceptance, subsequent output, and HTML can stream independently; navigation and hydration read/adopt the existing receipt and never redispatch the mutation. Receipt lookup still checks the viewer's authority.
- Reconcile a lost acknowledgement by operation ID rather than guessing from a canceled fetch. This needs neither a Promise as an RPC argument nor an implicit mutation during render.

The maintained conversation fixture requires an exact same-origin `Origin` and JSON content type on its authenticated POST endpoint, rejecting missing, `null`, and foreign origins before dispatch. This is that host's explicit CSRF policy, not a universal substitute for a host security review.

### Actions and optimistic acknowledgment

Optimistic writes are pinned to the owner and selected query key at their first tentative write:

- The projection observes a read-only source. A network action has a stable operation ID. Purely local same-turn writes may batch, but unrelated POSTs do not share an implicit transaction.
- Definitive rejection removes only that operation's overlay. Definitive success adopts an authoritative response or waits until the pinned source covers the write. An uncertain outcome retains its intent and ID for explicit reconciliation.
- A refetch for another selection cannot move an old overlay there. The host provides idempotency and durable receipts when reload or offline continuity matters.

For concurrent server writes, configure `optimistic$(source$, { compareAuthority })` before dispatch with the source's authoritative revision ordering. It compares the incoming receipt with current authority, never tentative overlays. A finite positive result permits publication; zero or a negative result confirms that operation and removes only its overlay without replacing authority. Receiving revision 2 and then revision 1 therefore settles both operations while authority remains at revision 2. Operation IDs, client dispatch order, selection generations, and transport sequence numbers are not server commit revisions.

The policy is shared by handles for the same source and owner; a different explicit comparator is a configuration error. Unversioned local uses may omit it and retain arrival-order adoption, but that mode does not guarantee freshness for concurrent server receipts. The host must also enforce freshness when installing independently fetched or streamed source values; the action comparator is not a global cache/stream merge policy.

If added, `op.until(() => source$.get())` has a narrow contract:

- It checks a synchronous predicate against **pinned authority without its own overlay**, immediately and after each authority update, and stops on timeout, retirement, or a definitive response. A tentative value cannot confirm itself.
- The compiler may bind provably local optimistic `set` calls to `op` across `await`; opaque helpers take `op` explicitly. Read computations can restart; dependency changes alone never retry a write.

This draws from [Solid's actions and optimistic proposal](https://github.com/solidjs/solid/blob/next/documentation/solid-2.0/06-actions-optimistic.md), with explicit operation identity for uncertain network writes. It does not assume `until` has shipped in Solid.

## Hybrid SSR: ordinary recursive phases

The page is a dependency graph, not a fixed shell followed by a fixed set of slots:

```text
Fast data → user data → first list page → older pages
Help data (independent sibling)
```

Ordinary `@try/@pending/@catch` arms describe what paints now and what replaces it when a read settles:

- The first phase may be static, cached, quickly fetched, or pending. Children can remain pending after parents resolve; an independent sibling can finish first. There is no special cached-shell component, `Slot` type, or maximum phase count.
- A dependent query waits for its selected key. The renderer adds no barrier between independent ready regions.
- A server may SSR a full list or conversation newest-to-oldest while the source protocol requests independently available older pages. Explicitly opaque HTML with a compact control model need not duplicate its entire body as serialized data.
- Native hydration instead requires enough state to reproduce **every tracked read** that rendered its range; otherwise HTML and hydrated values would diverge.

Cache hits and misses keep the **same component and boundary semantics**. Cacheability is host policy, not an author-facing phase:

- A host may cache eligible source data or invariant compiled template work by build, route, variant, authority, and source revision. Shared HTML cannot contain private values, a previous document ID, CSP nonce, or another request's result frame.
- Rebinding segment IDs and style ownership in cached rendered HTML needs separate proof. Initially, the host may cache inputs/templates and render a cheap request-specific frame.
- When a feature is off, its optional code must leave the eager import closure as well as the conditional HTML. Deferred CSS must be reachable before a late reveal. Atomic CSS reduces duplication, but does not remove ordering, transfer, or missing-style risk.

## One request, two complementary streams

One navigation carries two logical streams:

- **HTML** controls visibility; **resource frames** update browser signal values. A JavaScript Promise does not cross the wire.
- The server evaluates under its owner and keys frames by document, owner, feature instance, node, selected query arguments, attempt, build/protocol version, and sequence. The browser creates a *local* pending Promise for that selection. A small receiver can buffer a server result before the island graph exists, then settle its local Promise when the island joins; first adoption avoids a duplicate browser fetch.
- A later selection, refetch, or reset uses the compiled server-function stub or host loader. An `AsyncIterable` emits zero or more complete value frames and a terminal frame; each accepted yield updates the live signal. A one-shot Promise settles once.

```text
document d, instance todos.main, query todo("42"), attempt 1
open(1, "promise")
value(2, { id: "42", title: "Draft" })
complete(3)

boundary todo, presented selection "42", revision 1
HTML segment + matching read-frame identity + placement instruction
```

The example abbreviates a versioned tagged codec, not raw object interpolation into a script:

- The receiver checks identity and sequence, accepts each complete frame once, and turns a malformed, missing-terminal, cross-owner, or incompatible stream into a recoverable error. It never exposes an exception stack as a public error value.
- The codec accepts defined JSON-shaped values plus explicit `undefined` and negative zero, with canonical plain-object keys. Unsupported prototypes, cycles, functions, DOM nodes, and accessors fail. Decoding defines inert own data properties, including `__proto__`, without changing the object's prototype. Host validation and authorization still govern request arguments and private results.

Custom-class reducers/revivers and a switch to devalue are deferred. The existing RPC transport's use of devalue does not expand the streamed-signal codec contract; applications explicitly project domain objects into supported wire data.

**Wire mechanism.** A bootstrap runs before any placement or result script. A CSP-nonced inline result call to a tiny `resolveFrame(encodedFrame)` receiver writes a frame to the browser's local mailbox or resolves its waiting Promise.

- Encoding escapes script termination, HTML-sensitive characters, and the surrounding JavaScript context; data is never evaluated as source. This extends Octane's inline placement script with an independent result channel.
- Inert JSON data tags plus an observer are an alternative where policy forbids executable result scripts, at a scanning and queueing cost. The proposal favors the inline resolver **if** strict CSP and measured parser/byte behavior support it; either transport preserves the author API.
- Bootstrap order prevents a first frame from being lost. A bounded mailbox and per-channel deadline keep an unactivated island from retaining unbounded data.

**Trusted Types compatibility (future integration; implementation/enforcement tests excluded from this PR).** This is renderer/CSP work, separate from the async-signal author API:

- Browser parsing of response bytes is not a client DOM injection sink. Octane's streamed boundary swap, compiled templates, hydration raw-HTML path, and dynamic script URLs are. Under [Trusted Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API) enforcement, the core needs narrowly named, allowlisted policies for its generated markup and approved URLs, created once per realm.
- Applications own sanitation of authored raw HTML. The result codec must still escape HTML and script delimiters, and server HTML injection still needs trusted provenance and escaping; Trusted Types does not sanitize response bytes. A CSP nonce allows an inline script to execute but does not satisfy a Trusted Types sink.
- Verify report-only then enforced `require-trusted-types-for 'script'` without a permissive default policy, including table/SVG boundary placement, hydration, and deferred activation. Policy-free `trusted-types 'none'` is outside initial scope.

```typescript
// Generated into the HTML stream; not application-authored markup.
emitNoncedInlineScript(nonce, call("__octane.resolveFrame", encodeForScript(frame)));
// The emitted inline call runs as the parser encounters its result chunk.
```

```typescript
// Illustrative receiver internals, not a public author API.
const firstValue = receiver.expect(documentId, instanceKey, queryKey, attempt);
// The generated inline call accepts a complete matching frame and settles
// this browser-local Promise; the server Promise was never serialized.
const value = await firstValue;
```

The initial navigation interleaves two kinds of chunks on one HTTP response:

- Octane's `injection` source can emit complete result scripts **after the shell** in push order, holding the document tail until injection ends. HTML placement and data settlement remain logically independent.
- A later browser-initiated region fetch uses a separate HTTP response with the same identity, sequence, and recovery rules. It should reveal accepted chunks progressively rather than wait for the whole body.
- Nonce support and backpressure exist in the renderer today. Frame production, independent result adoption, and intent guards are additions.

Placement and data adoption can happen in either order:

- The renderer emits a fallback and a resolved segment with its own presented read frame. The parser may place that segment before the feature bundle evaluates. **Before changing the DOM**, placement checks document/owner/selection revision and required styles. A late Todo 42 segment cannot replace the user's new Todo 43 selection.
- The historical frame lets hydration read what produced the placed HTML while the live graph advances. A pending or error arm without a complete serializable seed recovers within its owned range. The renderer validates dependencies before committing a segment and releases provisional subscriptions on abandonment without disposing committed ones.
- Later stream values update live subscribers; server HTML does not replace the region on every yield. A separately fetched region follows the same identity and stream rules, with progressive placement rather than whole-response buffering.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant S as Server
  participant P as Browser parser
  participant R as Small receiver
  participant W as Deferred widget
  S-->>P: First HTML, pending arms, native controls, bootstrap
  P->>R: User input or selection advances local revision
  S-->>P: Ready HTML segment, read-frame ID, placement call
  P->>R: Check identity and intent before placement
  S-->>R: Nonced result frame, possibly before widget code
  R->>W: Match local Promise and historical frame
  W->>W: Adopt current DOM input, then activate this widget
```

Flow control covers the **entire** path:

- When an output queue reaches its high-water mark, the producer pauses `iterator.next()`; the renderer waits for writable pressure before emitting accepted HTML or data. The client bounds frames awaiting code and reports overflow.
- Abrupt close, abort, throw, timeout, and connection loss terminate affected channels exactly once. There is no universal 1 MiB cap: a deliberately large stream needs an explicit resource policy, a tested memory bound, and suitable paging/checkpoints.
- Large responses must avoid quadratic callbacks, repeated unchanged CSS/head serialization, and per-wave allocation spikes. An independent ready channel must reach the parser even while its sibling is slow.

## Early interaction and independent hydration

Before hydration, the DOM carries text, focus, caret, text selection, and IME composition:

- A small receiver starts before streamed placement, records an edit revision for **every** input including clear, and observes text selection and discrete intent. An IndexedDB or other restoration candidate applies only under the same owner and unchanged revision; a late read cannot overwrite a new edit.
- At handoff, the island reads the actual DOM value and revision, installs subscriptions, checks the revision again, and retires the early listener. It preserves the node and does not synthesize an input event.
- The server's historical frame explains the HTML; it never rewinds the live draft.

Octane has useful starting points, but independent activation needs more proof:

- Octane's [deferred hydration](https://github.com/octanejs/octane/blob/main/docs/deferred-hydration.md) provides `<Hydrate>` interaction capture and replay. Initialize it with `initializeHydrationEventCapture()` before `hydrateRoot`. `attachBehaviorRoot` attaches behavior to externally owned DOM.
- Existing `<Hydrate>` activates parent-first and keeps a persistent wrapper. It does not establish that a nested SSR widget can activate without evaluating a parent or sibling module. The [independent static-shell/island plan](https://github.com/octanejs/octane/blob/main/docs/hydration-islands-plan.md) remains a plan.
- Compiler and bundler must prove stable widget IDs and hook seeds, an immutable SSR range, serializable captures, lazy module evaluation, reachable CSS, and a local recovery boundary. A widget may contain many components, but activates as one independently owned unit.
- `<Hydrate independent ...>` explicitly requests that proof. Ordinary
  `<Hydrate>` retains parent-first behavior; a split or dynamic import alone does
  not opt in. Unsupported independent extraction is a compile-time error.
- A recent [compiler change](https://github.com/octanejs/octane/pull/1050) preserves `import defer` syntax. Actual lazy evaluation still depends on the loader and bundler; verify it with an executable example.

The receiver hands off an event only to its matching widget:

- An event contract maps the HTML target to a stable handler, owner, and widget. The receiver queues supported discrete intent, prioritizes **that widget's** code, and delivers it once if target, owner, and query selection still match.
- The behavior-root path can retain the original `Event` in the same document while deferred. Queued replay cannot restore expired transient user activation. Handlers needing synchronous `preventDefault`, navigation policy, or trusted activation must be available early; native links and text keep native behavior.
- A compiler-proven tiny descriptor may perform simple local selection before the widget loads; arbitrary closures cannot. For command payloads, an eagerly registered behavior's synchronous `captureEvent(event, element)` returns detached immutable input, delivered as the fourth `handleEvent` argument after readiness/adoption. Capture runs only after registration, not retroactively for events recorded by the default inline script. The queue remains owner-fenced and FIFO; it does not freeze arbitrary objects or infer which signals an action will read. See the [working behavior contract](./deferred-hydration.md#capturing-command-input-before-deferred-work).
- Measure first-click delay on a real slow connection. Use selective prefetch or a tiny eager handler if an urgent import is too slow. Optional controllers and transitive code remain unevaluated until needed.

After activation, a signal changing one attribute or style property should update its owned DOM slot without component-wide reconciliation or a duplicated stylesheet:

- Build on [fixed-key style lowering](https://github.com/octanejs/octane/pull/1051), preserving scalar fast paths. The landed [native signal styles](https://github.com/octanejs/octane/pull/1099) are canonical for style reading, including `style={{ ...props.style, left: left$ }}`. The renderer-free capability reuses that reader with separately tested property ownership and cleanup; native renderer support alone is not proof of renderer-free support.
- Any direct-binding syntax must preserve static CSS extraction, specificity/order, cleanup, and hydration ownership. `universalHostBinding` is opt-in for host properties, not proof of general native DOM binding.

## Core and signals work

The public author API should stay small because these are integrated runtime responsibilities rather than feature-specific adapters:

1. **Owned unified graph.** Add writable `signal$` and async-capable read-only `derived$` with a sync fast path and stream completion state; add `query$`'s tracked synchronous selector, canonical selection, sharing, `skip`, `refetch`, and `reset`. Preserve current strict `get`, initial `isPending`, whole-result `latest`, snapshots, cross-scope provenance, and disposal. The document/instance owner can be implicit for native renderer authors while explicit `createScope` remains for standalone clients.
2. **Attempt-bound continuations.** After `await`, ordinary JavaScript no longer has the synchronous active-node stack.
    - Each attempt gets a revocable `read(handle)`. It records dependency versions and awaits a pending value without rejecting the outer producer Promise. Before publishing a result or yield, it checks versions and aborts/restarts an obsolete idempotent read.
    - The compiler may lower proven `get()` calls, including those after `await`, to that reader. Ready dependencies keep the synchronous path.
    - Unsupported escapes, dynamic aliases, and opaque imported helpers use explicit `read` with clear diagnostics. There is no ambient async context or blanket Promise instrumentation. Uncompiled raw `get()` after `await` is outside the implicit contract.
    - Strong mode can prove local call graphs; it does not make every imported or effectful helper pure. Generic effects with post-`await` reads need their own analysis and lifecycle, not accidental render tracking.
3. **Render and transport identity.** Intern prepared graphs by document/account/feature instance/build, with exact bootstrap validation and deterministic repeated-instance paths. Carry selected arguments, attempt, owner, codec/protocol version, and presented read-frame revision across data and HTML. A boundary owns its historical lease, while the live graph may advance. Reveal requires a matching identity and styles; commit revalidates reads. Missing or incompatible channels recover inside their widget rather than cross-pairing by traversal order.
4. **Actions and server functions.** An optimistic projection observes authority; an action pins operation/selection/owner, distinguishes definitive and uncertain outcomes, and never restarts a write because a read invalidated. Server-function compilation separates serializable arguments and browser-local cancellation options from the trusted server-injected context. Each invocation reauthorizes, even when transported in a batch.
5. **Independent delivery and activation.** Emit HTML and result frames independently, apply backpressure, install a minimal early receiver before placement, preserve native input and once-only intent, and activate only the interacted widget. Compiler and bundler must prove independent module evaluation, capture and style reachability; a dynamic import textually present in source is insufficient. Keep signals-only imports free of the DOM renderer. Runtime binding updates targeted DOM properties without broad rerendering.

This division is intentional: the signal graph owns reads and attempts; the renderer owns placement and historical presentation; actions own write receipts; the host owns authorization and cache policy. It keeps both renderer code and a small standalone presenter viable. Core changes should deepen these owners rather than add a second app-specific session manager.

### Batching without a slow-result barrier

Calling two server functions need not force two connection setups or a slowest-member await. An optional transport coalescer groups compatible calls by endpoint, authority, account/document version, priority, and cancellation policy, with a bounded coalescing window. The server establishes shared request context, **authorizes each member**, starts independent eligible work, and emits each member's result as soon as it is ready:

```typescript
const detail = getTodo("42");
const preferences = getPreferences();
show(await detail); // Independent of preferences settling.
```

```text
request: batch { detail: getTodo("42"), preferences: getPreferences() }
response: detail value + complete
response: preferences value + complete (possibly much later)
```

Batching does not erase dependencies or write semantics:

- A genuine dependency stays ordered inside a server function or tracked query. A write joins unrelated speculative reads only with explicit order, idempotency, and cancellation.
- A slow channel cannot buffer every other result; a never-ending one has a deadline and independent terminal outcome. Canceling one member cannot abort another.
- [Cap'n Web](https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb) demonstrates batching and pipelined RPC. This initial protocol coalesces calls and streams independent results; it does **not** serialize unresolved browser Promises as RPC arguments. Pipelining would need its own authority and dependency rules.
- Fewer requests alone do not prove a faster useful result; measure both.

The initial executable transport uses
`batchServerCalls({ kind: "independent-reads", authority, document }, callback)`.
Only finite contextual calls made synchronously inside that callback coalesce,
up to 32 per request. Nested scopes, different documents, explicit per-call
budgets, and calls after an `await` do not silently join another group. The keys
are local compatibility labels, never server credentials. Each server member
crosses ordinary authorization with its own request state and deadline.
Multi-yield subscriptions stay on separate demand-driven requests; joining one
to a finite batch fails without replay. Canceling a dispatched finite member
detaches that caller, not its siblings or accepted server work. Mutations remain
outside this read-only batching opt-in, with explicit host operation receipts.

## Caching, paging, and performance

A source may return the first page and a real continuation token. The first request uses `null`; only a completed page advances using `nextBefore` from that page. A new query key selects the next page. The renderer can stream the newest completed HTML while older pages arrive, preserving stable item IDs and order. A partial stream value and a complete page are different states; an interrupted stream cannot invent a next cursor or silently mark a page complete. Opaque server HTML may carry a compact control model and cursor, whereas a natively hydrated list must include the read data used by its template. Choose between those modes explicitly to avoid doubling large content.

```typescript
import { signal$, derived$, query$ } from "octane/signals";
import type { Todo } from "./model";
type Page<T> = { items: T[]; nextBefore: string | null };
type SavedPage<T> = { before: string | null; items: T[] };
declare function fetchPage(before: string | null, options: { signal: AbortSignal }): Promise<Page<Todo>>;
declare function dedupeById(items: Todo[]): Todo[]; // Keep the first occurrence in page order.
export function createPagedTodos() { // Called under the document/feature owner.
  const before$ = signal$(null as string | null, { key: "before" });
  const completedPages$ = signal$([] as SavedPage<Todo>[], { key: "completed-pages" });
  const page$ = query$(() => before$.get(), (before, { signal }) => fetchPage(before, { signal }), { key: "items.page" });
  const visibleItems$ = derived$(() => dedupeById([
    ...completedPages$.get().flatMap((page) => page.items),
    ...page$.latest({ items: [], nextBefore: null }).items,
  ]), { key: "visible-items" });
  function older() {
    const page = page$.snapshot();
    if (page.status !== "ready" || !page.complete || page.value.nextBefore === null) return;
    const before = before$.get();
    completedPages$.set((pages) => pages.some((entry) => entry.before === before)
      ? pages : [...pages, { before, items: page.value.items }]);
    before$.set(page.value.nextBefore);
  }
  return { visibleItems$, older };
}
```

Caching is host policy at any eligible read or phase:

- Keys account for build, route, locale, authority, variant, source revision, and privacy. Cached data never carries another request's document identity, nonce, or private frame. Storage may supply completed data or a candidate local draft, but never replaces server authorization.
- A miss follows the same pending and hydration path. With the feature off, comparable production manifests must show that optional JS, CSS, and HTML stay out of the eager closure.
- Load styles for a late region **before** reveal. Atomic CSS still needs order and budget accounting.

Measure useful output and total cost under the same route and build conditions:

- Compare cold/warm data, fast/slow independent reads, delayed/no JavaScript, first/later selection, mobile CPU/network, and interrupted streams. Report first byte, first useful region, native input readiness, each result, first handler execution, final hydration, server work, allocations, and transport bytes.
- Report initial HTML (including inline frames), critical CSS, eager JS, deferred JS/CSS, and serialization separately. Moving bytes to another asset does not remove them.
- The upstream [streaming pressure investigation](https://github.com/octanejs/octane/issues/967) and [per-wave work investigation](https://github.com/octanejs/octane/issues/981) motivate scaled tests for accepted-frame loss, exact terminal settlement, callback growth, and CSS/head duplication. Test 32 staggered thenables and a deliberately large stream for bounded work, alongside a normal small page.

The target is faster useful output and interaction at acceptable total cost, not an unmeasured SSR or batching claim.

## Edge case handling

- **Connection loss or moving networks.** A complete ready region remains usable. An incomplete frame is discarded, its channel terminates once, and a new idempotent read may restart from a validated cursor/checkpoint. The original Promise and server iterator do not survive the connection. A write with no authoritative receipt stays uncertain; reconciliation checks its operation ID before any retry.
- **Concurrent early input and hydration.** The current DOM value, edit revision, owner, focus, caret, text selection, and IME state outrank a stale server seed or storage result. A late server segment is checked before placement. Handoff is atomic with respect to input events; it never sends an extra write or replays a cleared draft.
- **Navigation, BFCache, and account change.** Persisted pages freeze work and revalidate identity and pending channels on `pageshow`; ordinary navigation retires the document owner. An account or feature-owner change invalidates frames, subscriptions, caches, and optimistic receipts associated with the old authority. A late source that ignores `AbortSignal` is fenced by attempt generation.
- **Deployment and model version change.** HTML, read frame, serialized model, codec, styles, and client code carry a compatible version envelope. A retained document can adopt unchanged content, migrate a supported schema, keep compatible old assets, or re-render an owned widget while preserving recoverable local intent. It must not combine a new handler with incompatible old markup or silently recompute all previously rendered content. A follow-up while older history is streaming starts under the retained compatible owner or an explicitly reconciled upgraded one.
- **Truncation, overflow, and security.** A frame is accepted only when complete and escaped. Unexpected EOF, invalid sequence, unavailable style, mailbox limit, timeout, or stream error leaves coherent content and a retry path. The server sends public error metadata, not raw exceptions; authorization precedes private HTML or data and repeats for later RPCs. Never treat cancellation as proof a mutation was rejected.

## Scope, tradeoffs, and acceptance

This RFC proposes the integrated model, including after-`await` dependency tracking and independently activated islands. Its limits are explicit:

- Live Promises/iterators do not transfer across processes; arbitrary closures do not run before hydration; not every class is serializable; a lost write is not safe to replay.
- An initial implementation may restrict implicit tracking to compiler-proven call graphs and require explicit `read` elsewhere. That is an API contract, not a reason to abandon general async computations.
- A first delivery may cache data/templates instead of shared output HTML and may support a narrow set of early controls while preserving native behavior. These limits need diagnostics and recovery paths.

The acceptance bar is observable:

1. A result arriving before widget code is adopted once, without a duplicate initial fetch. A changed key, refetch, or retry starts exactly its selected attempt; old-owner and ignored-abort results never publish.
2. A dependency first read after `await` is tracked in compiled and explicit-reader paths. On invalidation, no mixed-version result or yield publishes. Synchronous derived reads keep their immediate fast path. Initial `isPending`, whole `latest`, stream `complete`, and cross-owner provenance preserve their established meaning.
3. Fast and independent regions reach the parser before a slow sibling. Each placed HTML segment has its exact historical frame, styles, and selection; a superseded segment fails **before DOM mutation**. Fetched later regions can progress without an await-all barrier.
4. Typing, clearing, text selection, composition, and focus before hydration survive storage restore, late HTML, and handoff. With an eager command capture policy, A → Save → B → Save submits A and B while the editor retains B; A → Save → clear submits A and retains the empty editor. Each command executes once in its matching owner; activating it does not evaluate unrelated widgets. Native link behavior, capture-registration timing, and synchronous activation limits remain explicit.
5. Concurrent optimistic writes remain pinned to their selections. With authoritative revision comparison, receipts 2 → 1 settle both operations while authority remains at revision 2. A definitive rejection removes only its overlay; uncertain acknowledgement remains identifiable across reconnect and does not trigger a second POST. Action-like GET parameters create no mutation, a POST failing CSRF validation never dispatches, and accepted POST receipts survive navigation/hydration without redispatch.
6. A slow batch member does not delay a ready member. Large and aborted streams respect producer/receiver bounds, release a terminal error or completion once, and show no accidental quadratic callbacks or unchanged CSS/head copying.
7. Comparable production builds and browser traces show eager/deferred bytes and import closures, first useful paint, first native input, first-click latency, server work, and result latency. A disabled optional feature emits no feature-specific eager HTML, JS, or CSS; CSS is present before each enabled region reveals.
8. A production behavior-only shell adopts initial SSR state, early edits and
   streamed async results with no renderer import, fetch or evaluation—even after
   behavior activation. Body/history share one authorization prerequisite and
   reveal independently. The host emits the early bootstrap before interactive
   HTML and does not pay duplicate legacy/new state-carrier costs. Measure inline
   capture, live signal/behavior support, later islands, HTML/data, and CSS
   separately; a generic hydration fixture does not establish this acceptance.
9. Source-faithful composer, standalone login, auth dialog, attachment, and safety
   views share authored SSR/live presentation and delete their redundant DOM
   builders, selectors, repair observers, and row maps. Existing controls retain
   identity, text selection, composition, and synchronous Send/Stop behavior. Keyed
   survivors retain per-item lifetime; removing and re-adopting a view cannot
   revive stale subscriptions or retire shared document state. Independently
   owned tokens, styles, and opaque descendants survive updates and cleanup.
   Report production HTML, inline JS, critical CSS, and deduplicated startup,
   first-interaction, Send, and deferred asset costs against the same baseline.
   Framework fixtures and passing resource tests alone do not establish the
   downstream deletion or native-device acceptance.

## Engineering decisions to verify

The September 15 [Jon review](https://github.com/octanejs/RFCs/discussions/3#discussioncomment-18450583) and [Dominic review](https://github.com/octanejs/RFCs/discussions/3#discussioncomment-18450790) remain open beyond the earlier three-item follow-up. The current candidate addresses speculative signal ownership on signal-free SSR paths and starts compiler-proven adjacent independent `query$` and `derived$` reads together, including complete static native JSX output with homogeneous read holes. Declaration laziness, true dependencies, strict read ordering, and cancellation remain part of that contract; arbitrary imported or property-based reads, opaque output and resource-loading hosts are not covered by this optimization.

Explicit signal transitions now have a private candidate graph joined to the renderer's existing action batches and presentation journals. Canonical values and public subscribers remain unchanged until the participating views and bindings can accept the candidate; urgent edits remain live, and superseded work loses publication authority. This implementation is still being qualified. In particular, receiver-owned SSR queries and unresolved historical adoption currently refuse explicit transition participation: even a completed SSR query needs a receiver-authority handoff before transition navigation can safely replace it. Parser-level independence from late CSS also remains open. The [implementation guide](./async-signals-implementation.md#new-core-team-review-remains-open) records the scoped implementation and qualification limits; passing existing tests does not settle every API or delivery requirement.

An initial integration may use immediate selection changes, cached-first or placeholder presentation, and independent result reveal without opting into explicit signal-transition retention. Such an integration must preserve strict pending/error behavior and reject obsolete results, but need not wait for the separate `useTransition` pending/retention work. This scoped adoption does not declare that broader RFC contract implemented. Parallel query starts, runtime performance, and final build/browser validation remain priorities for this delivery.

1. How much local, imported, and effectful Strong-mode code can the compiler prove safe for implicit post-`await` reads? Which unsupported paths receive an explicit-reader requirement, and how do we explain this boundary to authors without implying ambient async tracking?
2. What is the smallest independent widget manifest and model ABI that proves code, CSS, stable IDs/hook seeds, captures, historical reads, and version compatibility? Which native vs opaque HTML ranges can avoid duplicating large serialized data?
3. Which discrete events and early descriptors justify the receiver's eager bytes? Where must an actual handler run immediately because replay cannot provide synchronous cancellation or trusted activation? What is an acceptable first-click delay on mobile?
4. Should results use nonced inline resolver calls, inert data tags, or a policy-selected pair after measured parser cost and CSP/escaping tests? How are receiver mailbox and large-response budgets negotiated without an arbitrary fixed ceiling?
5. What is the minimum batching/coalescing contract and per-member backpressure policy? When is full pipelined RPC worth adding beyond independent result release?
6. Which cache products are worth supporting first: data, invariant templates, or safely rebased rendered HTML? What host proof covers auth, variants, invalidation, and version changes while keeping one recursive rendering model?
7. Verify that direct DOM bindings compose with fixed-key style lowering, CSS extraction, Strong-mode diagnostics, and independent widget ownership without broad component rerenders.

## Previous considerations

**2026-09-15:** Jon's review separates immutable command snapshots from live editor handoff, requires revision-aware adoption for concurrent server receipts, and limits GET entry to initialization or existing receipts. Leonid's concern is addressed by separating writable `signal$` from `derived$` and inspecting actual results on the general computation path; compile-time specialization is only an optimization. Custom serialization is deferred.

**2026-09-11:** This version separates upstream Octane contracts from proposed additions and treats independent widget activation, post-`await` reads, streamed result transport, and actions as one design target. Earlier alternatives are summarized below.

**2026-09-09:** An earlier design exposed a `scope` argument in every renderer author call and introduced a dedicated cached shell/`Slot` API. The engine still needs precise owner lifetime; normal renderer code can inherit its document/instance owner, and caching remains a policy of ordinary phases. Another draft split `asyncSignal$` and `query` from the author-facing read model and deferred general async computations; the unified model here is a proposal, not an assertion about existing exports.
