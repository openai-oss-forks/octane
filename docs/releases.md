# Releases

Changesets opens the `Version Packages` pull request. Publishing is a separate,
privileged workflow: after any successful `main` CI run, `publish.yml` checks
every publishable workspace version against npm and runs `changeset publish`
only when at least one version is missing.

Changesets creates the local annotated tags, but the action does not publish
them itself. A repository-owned reconciliation step pushes every missing tag in
one atomic transaction, then creates missing GitHub releases sequentially. This
avoids GitHub ref-hook failures during large releases, when the upstream action
would otherwise push one tag per package concurrently.

This is deliberately a reconciliation loop rather than a one-shot tied to the
Version Packages commit. If that commit's CI fails, a later fix on `main` can
publish the stranded versions after it passes the same required checks.
Pending changeset documents are isolated only inside the ephemeral publish
checkout so they cannot switch the publishing action back into version-PR mode;
the Release PR workflow remains their sole owner.

## New package bootstrap

npm trusted publishing can only be configured after a package exists. Before a
new public workspace package can join automated releases, a maintainer must
publish its first version interactively and then authorize this repository's
publish workflow:

```bash
pnpm --filter <package-name> publish --access public --no-git-checks
npm trust github <package-name> \
  --file publish.yml \
  --repo octanejs/octane \
  --allow-publish
```

Run this from a clean, validated `main` checkout with npm 11.15 or newer and an
npm account that owns the package and has two-factor authentication enabled.
The interactive publish is intentionally not automated with a long-lived token.

`pnpm release:preflight` lists every package that needs this bootstrap and exits
before any existing package is published. After bootstrapping, rerun the failed
Publish workflow, or dispatch `publish.yml` with the ID of any successful CI
push run on `main`.

For `@octanejs/electron` after this package lands on `main`:

```bash
pnpm --filter @octanejs/electron publish --access public --no-git-checks
npm trust github @octanejs/electron \
  --file publish.yml \
  --repo octanejs/octane \
  --allow-publish
```

## Recovery

The Publish workflow accepts only successful CI push runs from
`octanejs/octane`, the `main` branch, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. It also
requires every protected package, compatibility, typecheck, example, lint, and
test job to have succeeded.

Because npm package versions are immutable, the preflight is safe to repeat:
already-published versions are skipped. It also refuses a stale checkout when a
newer npm version exists, preventing an out-of-order workflow from moving the
`latest` tag backwards.

Tag and GitHub-release reconciliation is also idempotent. It runs after every
validated publish attempt, including partial failures, and repairs metadata for
every current version that npm confirms is published. If release creation fails
after the atomic tag push, the next successful main run or manual recovery
retries only the missing GitHub release. GitHub API availability cannot block
tag repair, and a package without a matching changelog entry is reported as
skipped so later releases can still be created.

After upload, reconciliation allows fifteen minutes of retry delays for npm to
make the versions available. It succeeds only when every current version can
be read from npm. A timeout leaves the missing versions listed in the workflow
summary; rerun the workflow once those versions become available.

An `E404` from a package upload can also mean npm rejected the workflow's
trusted-publisher identity, even when the package already exists. This is
different from a version that is still becoming available after a successful
upload. The public-registry preflight cannot inspect publishing permissions.
From an authenticated maintainer session, inspect the affected package:

```bash
npm trust list <package-name>
```

The trust must authorize direct publishing from `octanejs/octane` and
`publish.yml`, with no environment restriction (the workflow uses no GitHub
environment). If that trust is missing, configure it using the bootstrap command
above. Changesets can leave dependents unpublished when a dependency fails to
upload, so rerun the complete Publish job after repairing the trust. Its
preflight skips versions already present on npm.
