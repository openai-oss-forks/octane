# recursive-context bench — context fan-out across frameworks

A second benchmark adjacent to [`js-framework`](../js-framework/). Where
js-framework-benchmark measures wide flat-list rendering (1000 rows in a table),
this one measures **deep recursive component trees** with Context reads at every
leaf — the workload that stresses createBlock/renderBlock overhead per node,
hook-slot allocation per scope, and Context lookup through the active-component
parent chain.

```

The octane app is authored twice over the same octane core — `.tsrx` (directive
syntax: `@if/@else`, `class`) and React-style `.tsx` (JS control flow, `className`).
Both compile to working blocks over the same runtime, so the two octane columns
are a like-for-like read on the JSX backwards-compat path's cost for this
recursive-tree + Context workload.

Context maps to each framework's native mechanism: Octane, React, and Preact use
`createContext` + `useContext`; Solid uses signal getters as context values;
Svelte uses `createContext` with reactive objects; and Vue uses
`provide`/`inject` with shallow refs. Vue has no public synchronous flush, so
its update ops return `nextTick()` and the harness awaits that thenable inside
the timed window.

## Shape

Balanced binary tree, depth `D=10` → **1024 leaves**, **2047 total components**.
Each leaf reads two Context values (root + local) and renders one `<span>` with
the leaf's path + both values.

- Deep nesting (1000 levels) is degenerate (a single linear chain).
- Pure wide fanout (1000 siblings) is what `@for` already exercises in
  js-framework.
- A balanced tree exercises both axes: component-call overhead AND DOM
  reconciliation.

## Six measurements

The bench separates three orthogonal axes: **fan-out scope** (global vs subtree
updates), **structural change** (toggle a subtree on/off vs mutate a value), and
**teardown scale** (full container vs partial branch).

- **MOUNT** — empty DOM → fully painted tree. Exercises createBlock × N,
  renderBlock × N, hook-slot allocation × N, Context subscription × N.
- **UPDATE_ROOT** — mutates the root context value; **every leaf re-reads** (1024
  leaves). Exercises renderBlock × N, hook-slot lookup × N, Context lookup × N.
- **UPDATE_PARTIAL** — mutates state on a single mid-node at depth `M=5`; only its
  **2^(D−M) = 32 leaves** re-read. If the framework scopes descendant updates
  correctly, this should be ≈32× faster than UPDATE_ROOT. A ratio closer to 1×
  means the framework is wastefully re-running unaffected branches.
- **PARTIAL_UNMOUNT** — toggles a `visible` flag on the Mid component so the
  conditional render drops its subtree; **32 leaves** unmount, the rest of the
  tree stays put. Mid itself remains mounted so its state handle stays valid for
  re-show. Exercises per-block teardown without the full-container shortcut that
  UNMOUNT can take.
- **PARTIAL_REMOUNT** — flips the same flag back on; the **32-leaf subtree is
  constructed fresh** and re-subscribes to both contexts. Exercises a scoped mount
  path that exercises the same code as MOUNT but at 1/32 the work — useful for
  separating per-component overhead from total tree cost.
- **UNMOUNT** — full teardown via the framework's unmount API. Some frameworks
  (octane with the `container.textContent = ''` shortcut, Solid with
  owner-tree dispose) can short-circuit this; the contrast against PARTIAL_UNMOUNT
  shows whether the win is structural or only applies to the whole-container case.

Native **Preact** (`:5264`) uses core context and hooks. **Svelte 5** (`:5275`)
uses `createContext` with reactive context-scoped values so the 32-leaf local
provider remains isolated from the rest of the 2,047-component tree.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. From the repo root, install:
pnpm install

# 2. Production-build, preview, and drive all eight targets:
node benchmarks/bench.mjs --quick recursive-context
node benchmarks/bench.mjs recursive-context
```

The unified runner also executes `work.mjs` against the already-built Octane
previews. Run it directly with `pnpm --dir benchmarks/recursive-context
bench:work` when those two previews are already running.
Run `pnpm --dir benchmarks/recursive-context bench:cache` for the focused
context-cache gate. It builds the Octane production fixture and starts its own
preview on an ephemeral local port; no other preview servers are needed.

Output is a side-by-side table of median / min / p95 millis per op, followed by a
pairwise ratio block, e.g.:

```
octane-tsrx / vue-vapor ratio (score; <1 means octane-tsrx faster):
  mount             0.71x  ++ faster
  update_root       0.59x  ++ faster
  update_partial    0.84x  ++ faster
  partial_unmount   0.74x  ++ faster
  partial_remount   0.48x  ++ faster
  unmount           0.25x  ++ faster
```

## Measurement contract

Each adapter installs these globals on `window`:

| global               | what it does                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__mount()`          | calls the framework's mount API (deferred — index.html does NOT auto-mount, so MOUNT timing is meaningful) |
| `__updateRoot()`     | mutates the root context value; all leaves re-render                                                       |
| `__updatePartial()`  | mutates state on the mid-node at depth `M=5`; only its 32-leaf subtree re-renders                          |
| `__partialUnmount()` | flips Mid's `visible` flag to false; the 32-leaf subtree unmounts. Mid itself stays mounted                |
| `__partialRemount()` | flips Mid's `visible` flag back to true; the 32-leaf subtree is freshly constructed                        |
| `__unmount()`        | tears down via the framework's unmount API; does NOT pre-clear `target.children`                           |
| `__reset()`          | `__unmount()` + clear `target.children` — for between-iteration cleanup                                    |
| `__ready = true`     | last line of `main.js`; the harness gates on `page.waitForFunction("__ready")`                             |

The harness:

- **MOUNT**: fresh `page.goto` per sample so module-eval cost is amortized across
  iterations rather than across samples.
- **UPDATE_ROOT / UPDATE_PARTIAL**: one page, `__mount()` once, then loop
  `__updateRoot()` / `__updatePartial()` × (warmup + iter). The two are sampled in
  alternating rounds so any GC/JIT noise hits them symmetrically.
- **PARTIAL_UNMOUNT / PARTIAL_REMOUNT**: one page, `__mount()` once, then per
  iteration time `__partialUnmount()` followed by `__partialRemount()` and record
  BOTH halves. Alternating in lockstep means GC/JIT noise hits both ops
  symmetrically — important because they're mirrored work (tear down 32 leaves vs
  build 32 leaves).
- **UNMOUNT**: one page; per iteration `__mount()` (untimed), time `__unmount()`,
  then `__reset()` + small sleep before the next iteration.

After the semantic gate, the harness publishes zero-variance DOM censuses for
the mounted tree and the partial-unmount state. Visible element/text counts are
semantic controls; total/comment counts expose framework bookkeeping. The
Octane dialect timing rows also have order-balanced aliases: the primary
TSRX→TSX pass is repeated TSX→TSRX, and the two fully-warmed sample sets are
combined for TSX/TSRX ratio guards.

`work.mjs` observes emitted production bundles rather than adding source probes
that could change compiler purity. The unified runner first times the normal
minified builds; then the untimed work pass rebuilds the two Octane fixtures with
`vite build --minify false` so Chromium can attribute precise calls to named
functions. Run `bench:work` with both Octane preview servers running; it also
performs the diagnostic rebuild. A jitless Chromium precise-coverage pass caps
blocks, generic slots, descriptors, keyed survivor work, and teardown scopes at
their current levels while permitting reductions. Full/all-slot aggregates
allow a generic slot to become a cheaper specialized slot without allowing
duplicate dispatch. Every row requires live production-bundle coverage, and
root and partial updates must still execute exactly 1024 and 32 `setText` calls.

The TSRX leaf reads two local `createContext` values and no promises. Before
removing its redundant context-only `useBatch`, the 1024-leaf mount and root
update each called `useBatch` 3072 times; the 32-leaf partial update and
remount each called it 94 times. The baseline after that removal was 2048 and
62 calls, respectively, all
`useBatch([], warmThunk)` child-plan registrations. Replacing that empty batch
with `registerWarmPlan(plan, props)` retained 2048 registrations on mount/root
update and 62 on partial update/remount. The compiler now recognizes that these
local context reads and providers add no async work to start early, so both
helpers have zero-call gates for these operations. The JSX twin also stays at
zero. Authored context reads remain, and `setText` still runs exactly 1024/32
times for root/partial updates. These counts measure eliminated registration
work, not end-user latency.
The normal DOM checks in `run.mjs` verify all 1024 leaf paths, both context
values, the isolated 32-leaf provider update, and remount identity.

A separate production entry (`warm-plan-control.html`) renders a parent with
its own promise creation and a same-module async child. Its nonempty batch must
still start the independent child before the parent suspends. A fresh Chromium
pass verifies the visible parent/child values and that each resource starts
exactly once. The fallback warm registration now uses `registerWarmPlan(thunk,
undefined)`, so the suspending mount/retry requires three direct `useBatch`
calls (parent twice, child once) and one plan registration on the successful
parent retry. Parsed production output verifies that the parent
keeps its direct batch, while the trailing empty batch array disappears.

Other compiler controls cover child-only parents with reassigned props and a
locally shadowed component name. Their in-body warm closure cannot be replaced
by a lookup of the attached plan; the registration uses that same closure. A
parent-only module imports its async child so its one previous `useBatch` import
and call can disappear altogether: the candidate must emit zero batch imports
and calls, one `registerWarmPlan` import and call, and no empty batch array.
The same source compiled in server and universal modes keeps its existing
empty-batch registration. Standalone work-gate runs may set
`RECURSIVE_WORK_TARGETS` to JSON target URLs for isolated ephemeral preview
ports, avoiding stale assets from other worktrees.

Before this change, the parent/child browser fixture called `useBatch` four
times and `registerWarmPlan` zero times on mount/retry. The three client
compiler controls (own promise, reassigned props, shadowed name) emitted
3/2/2 batch call sites, including one empty-array registration each. The
parent-only module emitted one batch import, one empty-array call site, and no
plan import. Server and universal output each emitted one empty batch call site
for that module. These are deterministic source and browser call counts, not a
measured latency or heap-allocation improvement.

The same work pass also compiles a plain TypeScript custom hook with two reads
from a directly initialized module context in both client and server modes. Its
codegen-size gate permits no growth beyond the authored source, preserves both
`use()` calls, and requires zero generated `useBatch`/`puBatch` imports or calls.
A separate mixed context/promise hook must still generate one batch call in each
mode, confirming that the analyzer detects the helper when batching is needed.

The context-cache work pass builds a second production HTML entry in the TSRX
fixture. It renders 512 keyed consumer components with zero, one, or two
**distinct** context reads and identical visible DOM. An initialization script
wraps the browser's native `Map` constructor; the harness resets its counter
around mount, root-context update, second-context update, keyed reorder, and
unmount. An explicit `new Map()` verifies the probe. It checks every row's
text and identity after updates and reversal, including the second provider's
new value in the two-context case, and checks teardown. The zero-context
fixture controls for shared root, provider, and keyed-row allocations.

Before the inline single-context cache, mount constructed 6 Maps for the
zero-context control and 518 Maps each for one- and two-context consumers: 512
extra Maps in each reader mode. The exact production gates now require zero
extra Maps for the one-context mode and 512 for the two-context spill. All
three modes must incur no extra Map construction over the zero-context control
on subsequent updates, reorder, and teardown. The gate runs from `work.mjs`
after its precise-coverage pass, and can also run independently via
`bench:cache`. A fresh, uninstrumented browser realm records 40 batches of
20 root updates per mode with 12 warmup updates; update times are diagnostics,
not wall-time pass/fail gates.

Default: 10 warmups + 20 iters. Pass an integer to `bench` to override iters
(`bench:long` runs 40).

## Warm-cache ancestor work

`pnpm --dir benchmarks/recursive-context bench:warm-adoption` builds a dedicated
production entry and starts a preview on an ephemeral localhost port. The main
`bench:work` pass runs the same guard using its existing preview and browser.
The fixture mounts and updates a chain of ordinary synchronous custom-hook
`useMemo` values after an unrelated async root has warmed and unmounted. Every
value and surviving DOM node is checked. A fresh realm with no warming is the
zero-work control; a pending parent/child resource pair checks the
live warm-cache path, concurrent starts, final values, and one creation per
resource through retry.

The untimed runner enables detailed Chromium coverage on unminified production
output. It finds `adoptWarmEntry`'s parent-property read through the emitted AST
and uses the narrowest enclosing coverage range to count actual parent steps.
No probes are inserted into authored components or runtime source. At depths
32 and 128 (33 and 129 memo values), the baseline performs 1,089 and 16,641
parent steps on both mount and update after unrelated warming. The guard
requires zero steps while retaining all 33/129 adoption calls. The pending
retry must still perform one warm-cache probe and one or two parent steps.

`BENCH_JSON` records operation counts and source/helper hashes. Use `--measure`
with the standalone runner to record historical implementations without the
zero-parent-step ceiling. This measures ancestor lookup work, not total render
cost or end-user latency; compiler and scheduler work outside the helper remains
covered by the existing recursive-context suites.
