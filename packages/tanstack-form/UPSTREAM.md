The runtime core and React oracle have been updated to 1.33.5. All ten published React adapter source files are byte-identical to 1.33.2, so the original source and test provenance remains pinned above. The imported core fixes field deletion removing siblings whose names share a prefix. `tests/conformance/repo-regressions.test.ts` covers that behavior through the public Octane package exports and fails with 1.33.2.

The canonical tagged repository contains runtime and compile-time suites. The
published npm artifact contains source and declarations but omits those tests,
so provenance remains `recorded-unverified`. `upstreamSuites.runtime` and
`upstreamSuites.types` remain `present` because the repository pin has those
suites; promoting them into pristine runtime/type lanes with complete
dispositions is open follow-up work before provenance can move to `verified`.

This bounded harness currently executes:

- the faithful adapted `createFormHook`, `useField`, `useForm`, and
  `useFormGroup` wrappers through the `tanstack-form` Vitest project
  (`testExecution.include` lists only those files);
- one exact shared React/Octane differential interaction fixture;
- the repository-authored adapted type contract as an optional lane (not
  required parity evidence).

StrictMode-adapted cases (`onChangeListenTo`, StrictMode-named `useField`
scenarios), repository-only regressions, documented Octane-only divergences,
and SSR stay ordinary package tests outside React-parity ownership until
pristine upstream suites land.
