- React oracle: workspace React 19.2.7

The binding reuses the upstream framework-neutral vanilla store, shallow comparator, and middleware. It adapts the React-facing `create`, `useStore`, `createWithEqualityFn`, `useStoreWithEqualityFn`, and `useShallow` hooks onto Octane subscriptions.

## Runtime dependency

The runtime dependency and React differential oracle now use `zustand@5.0.15`. Its React adapters and public declarations are byte-identical to 5.0.14. The changes are in the imported middleware: clearing persisted storage invalidates pending hydration, and devtools action names handle async and constructor stack frames. The original adapter source pin above remains the provenance baseline. The persistence regression in `tests/conformance/extras.test.ts` fails with 5.0.14 and verifies that late hydration cannot restore cleared state.

## Export crosswalk

| Upstream entry | Octane entry | Disposition | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `zustand` | `@octanejs/zustand` | React hooks ported; vanilla exports reused | differential counter/multistore cases and `conformance/binding.test.ts` |
| `zustand/vanilla` | `@octanejs/zustand/vanilla` | Re-exported unchanged | conformance tests |
| `zustand/shallow` and `zustand/react/shallow` | `@octanejs/zustand/shallow` | Comparator reused; hook ported | `conformance/extras.test.ts` |
| `zustand/middleware` | `@octanejs/zustand/middleware` | Re-exported unchanged | `conformance/extras.test.ts` |
| `zustand/traditional` | `@octanejs/zustand/traditional` | Equality hooks ported | `conformance/traditional.test.ts` |

## Test-suite disposition

The canonical tag includes React runtime suites for basic hooks, shallow selection, SSR, subscriptions, persistence, devtools, and middleware, plus embedded type assertions. They are present but not executed unchanged here. Two exact same-fixture React/Octane scenarios cover representative selection, actions, and multiple-store behavior; Octane-only ordinary-shard coverage authenticates equality, rejection of uncached selector snapshots, and recovery with shallow selection (not adapted React parity evidence). The upstream type suite is broad and intertwined with React fixtures, so this recorded-unverified retrofit carries a focused executable public declaration contract rather than claiming one-for-one adapted coverage.
