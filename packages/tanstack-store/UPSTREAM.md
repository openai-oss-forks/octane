The runtime dependencies have advanced to 0.11.1. All eight published React adapter source files are byte-identical to 0.11.0, so the original source and test provenance remains pinned above. The existing pristine source suites, adapted suites, differential scenarios, and public type checks are retained and run against the updated dependency closure.

The tagged repository contains the upstream runtime and compile-time suites. The
published npm artifact contains source and declarations but omits those tests, so
the repository pin is vendored under `packages/tanstack-store/upstream/` and pinned by
`audit/upstream.lock.json`: each committed file verifies offline against its upstream git blob
sha at the pinned commit (`pnpm react-port:materialize run --check --package-dir
packages/tanstack-store`). The upstream MIT license is retained byte-exact as
`LICENSE.upstream`, hash-matched to the lock.

Run `pnpm --dir packages/tanstack-store upstream:verify` to verify every vendored
byte. The pristine React-parity lanes run that same verifier before copying or
executing the upstream suite.

## React-parity lanes

Paired pristine and adapted lanes are required evidence; bounded differential and
adapted-only lanes are supplementary.

| Lane | Disposition |
|---|---|
| `tanstack-store-pristine-upstream` | Runs the byte-exact 0.11.0 `packages/react-store/tests/index.test.tsx` suite and adapter source with the 0.11.1 core after vendored-byte verification. |
| `tanstack-store-adapted-upstream` | Runs the one-for-one Octane adaptation in `tests/_fixtures/upstream/index.tsrx` through `tests/conformance/upstream-index.test.ts`. Omits the upstream `_useStore` describe block by design. |
| `tanstack-store-pristine-types` | Runs vendored `upstream/tests/test.test-d.ts` with `tsc` against the pinned React binding, including `_useStore` typetests. |
| `tanstack-store-adapted-types` | Runs the structurally equivalent Octane typetest in `typetests/test.test-d.ts` with `tsrx-tsc` via `typetests/tsconfig.adapted.json`. `_useStore` typetests are pristine-only. |
| `tanstack-store-useStore-omission-types` | Compiles the authenticated Octane-only `_useStore` omission typetest via `typetests/tsconfig.json`. Ordinary runtime omission evidence stays outside react-parity ownership. |
| `tanstack-store-runtime-differential` | Supplementary exact shared React/Octane interaction fixture. |

## Runtime suite disposition

| Upstream artifact | Disposition |
|---|---|
| `tests/index.test.tsx` | Pristine lane runs unchanged. Adapted one-for-one in `tests/_fixtures/upstream/index.tsrx` except the `_useStore` describe block (`returns selected state and actions for stores with actions`, `returns selected state and setState for plain stores`), which is classified outside adapted parity evidence. |
| `tests/test-setup.ts` | Shared cleanup setup used by the pristine lane unchanged. |
| `tests/test.test-d.ts` | Pristine types lane runs unchanged. Adapted types mirror every assertion group except the `_useStore` blocks. |
| `src/*` | Vendored for pristine runtime/type execution because the upstream suite imports `../src/index`. |

## Intentional divergences

- `@octanejs/tanstack-store` intentionally omits the experimental `_useStore` export.
  Required type evidence lane: `tanstack-store-useStore-omission-types`
  (`typetests/_useStore-omission.test-d.ts` via `typetests/tsconfig.json`).
  Ordinary runtime evidence: `tests/conformance/experimental-use-store.parity.test.ts`
  (outside react-parity ownership).
- Documented Octane-only divergences and SSR stay ordinary package tests outside
  React-parity ownership.
