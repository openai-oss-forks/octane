# @octanejs/xstate

## 0.0.11

### Patch Changes

- a6d7f49: Remove the legacy `Context.Provider` alias from client, server, and native contexts. Provide values with `<Context value={value}>` or `createElement(Context, { value }, children)` instead. The compiler rejects statically recognized legacy Provider access with migration guidance, and Octane bindings now use contexts directly. Binding peer ranges accept Octane 0.3 alongside their previously supported runtime lines.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 106070e: Add `@octanejs/xstate`, a port of `@xstate/react@6.1.0`.

  `xstate` itself is framework-neutral and is consumed unmodified as a peer
  dependency; only the React binding is ported, module for module, with `src/`
  mirroring the upstream layout so the two trees read side by side. Every export
  of the pinned entry point is accounted for in `UPSTREAM.md`: `useActor`,
  `useActorRef`, `useSelector`, `useMachine`, `createActorContext`, and
  `shallowEqual`. Two of upstream's npm dependencies are React-specific and are
  replaced rather than consumed —
  `use-sync-external-store/shim/with-selector` keeps its exact memoization
  algorithm on Octane's native `useSyncExternalStore`, and
  `use-isomorphic-layout-effect` becomes a slot-forwarding helper.

  The pinned release's own suite is the parity oracle, run both ways. The
  `xstate-pristine` lane spawns the byte-exact vendored suite against
  `@xstate/react@6.1.0` and `react@19.2.3` (144 of 144 cases), and
  `xstate-adapted-upstream` reruns the same 75 case identities on Octane through
  TSRX fixtures. Both type suites run too: the vendored one under plain `tsc`, and
  a one-for-one adapted one under `tsrx-tsc`. A differential lane drives one
  fixture through this binding and through the real `@xstate/react`, asserting
  byte-identical `innerHTML` after every click with `xstate@5.32.5` shared by both
  sides, so any difference is attributable to the binding.

  Four divergences are recorded in `audit/react-parity.json`, each bound to the
  cases that pin it. Octane has no StrictMode double-invoke, so upstream's eight
  `suiteKey === 'strict'` counts collapse to their non-strict values; error
  boundaries are `@try`/`@catch` blocks rather than class components;
  `useSyncExternalStore` gates its commit-time sync on the value instead of
  re-reading `getSnapshot`, which is unreachable for actors that notify; and the
  server snapshot is optional and falls back to `getSnapshot` where React throws.

  `createActorContext` stays plain `.ts` on purpose: its returned hooks forward
  the caller's compiler-assigned slot, and a compiled `.tsrx` would append its own
  symbol after the forwarded one and collapse every consumer call site onto a
  single hook cell.

- 7535acd: Deduplicate binding hook sub-slot derivation behind Octane's shared helper while preserving each binding's slotless and symbol-identity behavior.
