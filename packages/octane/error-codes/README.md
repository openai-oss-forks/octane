# Octane production error codes

`codes.json` is the canonical, Octane-owned catalog for framework-created errors
in the core DOM client and server runtimes (`runtime.ts` and
`runtime.server.ts`) that remain observable in production. The numbers are
unrelated to React's error codes.

- Add new codes at `nextCode`, then increment `nextCode`.
- Never reuse or renumber a published code.
- Changing a published message or its argument shape requires a new code.
- Keep retired entries in the catalog with `"status": "retired"` so deployed
  error URLs remain decodable.
- Compiler diagnostics, user-thrown errors, and errors in other runtime surfaces
  do not belong in this initial catalog tranche.

The generator emits surface-specific development lookup modules for the client
and server runtimes. Development builds reconstruct the complete catalog message;
optimized production bundles retain only the compact code, ordered URL arguments,
and a link to `https://octanejs.dev/errors/<code>`. Error construction stays at
the original call site so `Error` subclasses, `TypeError`, `AggregateError`
contents, stacks, and other observable identity are preserved.

The generator currently scans those two core DOM runtime files exhaustively. A
future runtime surface must opt in deliberately, with its own bundle and behavior
coverage, rather than relying on this catalog's guarantees implicitly.

The renderer-free document signal capability reuses the client signal ABI code
because it is also reachable through the core runtime. This shared diagnostic
does not enroll other signal-engine errors in the catalog. Its formatter import
must remain renderer-free and its production bundle cost is measured separately.

The website imports this committed catalog directly and decodes the same revision
at `/errors/<code>`; it must not fetch a mutable external error map. Consequently,
published numbers and their argument shapes are a compatibility contract even
though Octane does not support versioned React diagnostic catalogs.

Run `pnpm error-codes:generate` after editing the catalog. CI uses
`pnpm error-codes:check` to validate the schema and generated runtime modules,
and compares the catalog with the PR base (or previous main commit) to reject
published-code deletion, renumbering, message/argument drift, and reactivation.
