# @octanejs/cli

## 0.0.11

### Patch Changes

- 5ead1ff: Add owner-bound signal declarations, async derivations and keyed streams, direct native signal bindings, and independent hydration infrastructure. Add request-local server-call context, bounded streamed RPC, and explicitly batched independent reads. Preserve operation identity and cancellation boundaries across navigation and uncertain acknowledgements.

  Allow a later widget activation to retry a failed framework-loaded stylesheet
  without discarding queued interactions or revealing the widget before CSS loads.

  Support renderer-free global signal and streamed-state activation for hosts that
  retain server-owned HTML. Adopt initial document seeds before behavior reads,
  preserve early edits, bind native control properties without reconciliation, and
  let envelope owners emit the early capture script before interactive markup
  without duplicating it in rendered fragments.

  Catalog the new core runtime diagnostics while preserving their error classes,
  and verify the published streaming bootstrap subpath and inline script export.

  Keep individual and batched server calls on the page's origin when an authored
  base element points to another origin.

  Keep reusable DOM, CSS, and component prop types scalar while allowing direct
  signal bindings at native JSX sites, preserving existing binding consumers.
  Use scalar public props for Zag's state-machine normalization results and
  to-print's imperative iframe options.

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 888e71d: Declare imported and lifecycle-owned Anime.js surfaces and recommend direct upstream imports for vanilla APIs in the package documentation and CLI binding catalog. Existing convenience exports remain supported.
- 527358c: Complete the remaining Strong compiler checks for fetch-driven effects, effect chains, prop-derived initial state, explicit and null dependencies, manual memo hooks, JSX list mapping, index keys, suppression props, trusted HTML, and compatibility imports. Preserve equivalent dependency arrays as hints and report them without failing strict CLI analysis. Add compiler-owned declaration caching for Strong authoring, the `trustHTML`/`TrustedHTML` API, and nominal Strong JSX types while preserving compatibility modules.

  Strong opt-in intentionally changes generated code for eligible hook-input declarations: their identities are cached in development and production until inferred inputs change. It also normalizes proven built-in hook aliases and infers dependencies for unshadowed `undefined` placeholders. This applies to both the directive and the global `strong: true` option. Ordinary callbacks and mutable values retain their authored evaluation and lifetime. The keyed `@for` migration applies to `.tsrx`; keyed JSX mapping remains supported in `.tsx`.

  CLI JSON reports include the hint count even when it is zero, and MDX diagnostic types represent errors, warnings, and hints.

  The eager prop-state check covers both `useState(value)` and `useReducer(reducer, value)`. A lazy state initializer or explicit third reducer initializer declares a deliberate initial capture. Subscription and timer callbacks keep their event-driven semantics and are excluded from effect-chain writes.

## 0.0.9

### Patch Changes

- 8adc693: Add an opt-in experimental scoped signal engine backed by Alien Signals 3.2.0, with owned async resources, retained values, ready-state adoption, and native compiler read tracking. Expose the `nativeReads` compiler option through the application and bundler integrations while preserving explicit hook dependency arrays and the external Alien Signals binding.

  The experiment is not a stable API or a release recommendation. Local derived and async hooks remain deferred, and the accompanying evidence distinguishes supplemental compiler, runtime, and browser checks from the acceptance gates for the locked workspace.

  Expose native read ownership and cached activity metadata through the existing DevTools inspector without evaluating signals or retaining a global graph registry. Match the private compiler ABI's CommonJS entry points to the public runtime so native SSR reads use one protocol instance.

  Collect native reads around actual component invocation, including parameter defaults and indirect returns. Track and replay native reads in inferred memos, preserve deferred element inspection and rendering, and revoke live retained results when a contributing data owner retires. Keep held Suspense output, refs, effects, and native subscriptions together until replacement work is accepted.

  Avoid duplicate native collection setup when invocation collection already owns the scope, while preserving independent child retirement, observer restoration, write guards, and stored-value witness replay.

  Preserve nested Suspense ref lifetimes, finish caught deletion cleanup before replacement effects connect, and reveal the latest urgent state when it supersedes every held state update. Register native compiler and server hook diagnostics in the production error catalog and CLI explanations.

## 0.0.8

### Patch Changes

- b3537b4: Register `@octanejs/textarea-autosize` in the CLI and MCP migration mappings.

## 0.0.7

### Patch Changes

- d275405: Generate disposable SPA application roots in the form recognized by Octane's production compiler, reducing scaffolded application bundle size without changing reusable root behavior.

## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- e814506: Finish the install when pnpm blocks a dependency build script.

  pnpm refuses to run a dependency's install script until the project records a
  decision about it, and since 11.0 it says so by failing the command, after the
  packages are already on disk. `octane init` and `octane create` read any
  non-zero exit as a dead install and stopped there, which left the dependencies
  installed and the dev dependencies missing: the generated app had no bundler,
  and `pnpm dev` died on `Cannot find package 'vite'`. Scaffolding a `fullstack`
  app with pnpm 11 hit this every time, since `esbuild` reaches that tree and
  carries an install script.

  Installs driven by the scaffold now name the build scripts the generated app
  needs, passing `--allow-build=esbuild` to pnpm: that install script is how
  vite's platform binary arrives. Only that package is approved, so a build script
  arriving through some other dependency stays the user's decision. pnpm older
  than 10.4 does not take the flag and the install is retried without it, and
  `--allow-build` is never passed to npm, yarn, or bun, which would read it as a
  package name.

  A blocked build script the CLI did not name no longer aborts the run either. The
  packages installed, so setup continues and the pending decision is reported
  under `Do this by hand` as a `pnpm approve-builds` step.

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- bd8bb1b: Require Node.js 22.22.2 or newer across Octane's published packages.

  Add the `octane/compiler/register` preload for running server and SSG scripts
  directly with Node or Bun. It compiles imported `.tsrx`/`.tsx` modules and
  plain TypeScript custom hooks in server mode without a Vite build. Bun also
  targets bare `octane` imports at `octane/server` in pass-through authored source
  dependencies, including packages that manage their hook slots manually.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 522c083: Scaffold a landing page instead of a placeholder, and give `fullstack` the
  routes that justify its name.

  `octane create` and `octane init` previously wrote an `App.tsrx` reading "Hello
  from Octane", and `fullstack` differed from `spa` only by an `octane.config.ts`
  carrying a single route — so the template that exists to demonstrate routing,
  SSR and hydration demonstrated none of them, and the first thing a new project
  showed was a placeholder to delete.

  Both templates now open on a landing page: the Octane mark, and cards linking
  into the documentation. `fullstack` additionally scaffolds `/counter`, which
  arrives server-rendered and becomes interactive on hydration, a `Layout.tsrx`
  the two pages share, and a `GET /api/health` `ServerRoute` — a handler returning
  a `Response` rather than a component, which is the half of the app layer `spa`
  has no equivalent for.

  The palette, typography and card styling are octanejs.dev's own, so a scaffolded
  app and the documentation look like one thing. `src/styles.css` carries the
  tokens and both colour schemes and the shell links it; each component keeps its
  own scoped `<style>`. No CSS framework, nothing to uninstall.

  The stylesheet is linked from the shell rather than imported by a component,
  because a CSS import is injected by JavaScript in dev and the tokens would
  arrive after the server-rendered markup that reads them. When `init` runs
  against a project that kept its own `index.html`, it writes the stylesheet and
  states the `<link>` to add, the same way it already states the SSR markers.

  `tsconfig.json` now includes `octane.config.ts`, so a route entry naming an
  export that does not exist fails `typecheck` rather than at request time.

  `octane init --mode fullstack` no longer writes an entry component into a
  project that brought its own `octane.config.ts`. The pages belong to the routes
  this command declares; that config names its own entries, which may not be these
  files at all, so writing them produced components nothing routed to. A missing
  entry in someone's own config stays `octane doctor`'s to report.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 8c72c58: Reject arguments after a bare `--` instead of dropping them.

  No command reads the tokens after `--`, so every one of them was discarded in
  silence. That is reachable by an ordinary route: npm consumes the `--` itself
  and forwards what follows, so `npm create octane app -- --template spa` is the
  correct npm spelling, and the identical line under pnpm or yarn hands the `--`
  through to the CLI. The flags then vanished and the run failed reporting that
  `--template` was required, naming the one flag that was sitting in the caller's
  command line.

  Those tokens are now a usage error that names them and says which package
  managers need the `--`. A command that wants to read them declares
  `passthrough`, and a bare `--` with nothing after it discards nothing and stays
  valid.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 5ec8998: Add `octane create` and `create-octane`, and give `octane init` the files an app
  needs to actually run.

  `npm create octane my-app` now scaffolds a project from an empty directory.
  There are two templates, matching the two shapes `octane init` already knew:
  `spa` for a client-only app, and `fullstack` for routing, server rendering, and
  a production build.

  The scaffold is `octane create`, a command in the CLI. The published
  `create-octane` is only the entry point: `npm create octane` arrives with the
  project name as the first argument, so its bin puts `create` in front of argv
  and hands over. Everything else, including the two templates and the files
  themselves, is shared with `octane init`, which does the same work against a
  project that already exists.

  Leave an argument off and you are asked for it, so `npm create octane` on its
  own walks through a project name, offered as `octane-app`, and a template. A
  flag always wins over a question, and with nothing to answer on, a missing
  argument is a usage error rather than a prompt nobody can see.

  On a terminal it still lists what it will write and install and asks to confirm,
  the same as running `octane init` yourself. Declining leaves nothing behind: the
  directory and the manifest it had created are removed and it says so, rather
  than reporting a project that was never written.

  Installing goes through the manager that ran the command, read from
  `npm_config_user_agent`, so `pnpm create octane` installs with pnpm rather than
  answering a pnpm user with a `package-lock.json`. The next steps it prints name
  that manager too, and quote the directory, since a name with a space in it is
  accepted and `cd My App!` is not a command anyone can paste. After
  `--no-install` they point at the package list `init` printed, rather than at an
  `install` that would resolve a manifest with nothing in it yet. For this `init`
  gains `--package-manager <name>`, which also covers running it by hand in a
  project that has no lockfile to detect yet.

  One other CLI fix came out of that. `--yes` now means "stop asking" on a
  terminal too, for every kind of question rather than only the confirm: it was
  consulted once the CLI had decided nobody was watching, so typing it in a real
  shell did nothing, and `octane create --yes` then blocked on the very questions
  the flag was meant to answer. A question with no default has nothing to answer
  with, so it is still asked.

  The package entry exports what it did before. `resolveMode` and
  `PACKAGE_MANAGERS` were briefly added for a caller that drove `main` from
  another package, and that caller no longer exists.

  `ctx.ui` gains `text`, the free-text prompt the project name needs. An empty
  submission means the offered default, so accepting it by pressing enter and
  typing it out land in the same place.

  Both templates are deliberately bare: one component, no styling, and the
  smallest config that runs. A scaffolded project also passes its own
  `prettier --check` from the first commit, which meant generating the files in
  Prettier's own default style rather than the repository's.

  `init` now writes a `.prettierrc` registering `@tsrx/prettier-plugin`, and
  installs it along with `prettier`, because Prettier cannot parse `.tsrx` without
  it. A project that already has a Prettier config keeps it, and is told which
  plugin to add, the same rule already applied to a bundler config. Which config
  gets read follows Prettier's own search order, so the `prettier` field of
  package.json wins over a config file when a project has both. A field holding a
  path is followed to the file it names, and one naming a shareable config is
  reported as settings this command cannot read.

  `init` also installs `typescript`, at the range `@tsrx/typescript-plugin`
  declares as its peer, read from the plugin once it is on disk rather than
  chosen here. It is a required peer of the plugin that ships `tsrx-tsc`, and
  nothing in the toolchain carries a compiler of its own, so npm and pnpm install
  it themselves but yarn does not: `yarn create octane` used to produce a project
  whose `typecheck` script died on `Cannot find module 'typescript'`. Naming the
  package with no range is not the fix either, since that takes the newest major,
  which `tsrx-tsc` cannot start under. With `--no-install` the range cannot be
  read yet, so the package is named in the list to install by hand instead.

  A directory has to be empty, except that a fresh `.git` is allowed,
  since `mkdir app && cd app && git init` is a common way to start and holds no
  work to protect. A name that lands on an existing file is reported as one,
  rather than read as a directory and thrown as `ENOTDIR`.

  `octane init` itself wrote no HTML shell and no client entry, in either mode.
  That left `--mode spa` with a wired-up bundler, no entry component, and nothing
  for `vite` to open, while `--mode fullstack` produced a project whose production
  build failed outright, because `@octanejs/vite-plugin` requires an `index.html`
  once `octane.config.ts` declares routes. Both modes now get an `index.html`, spa
  also gets a `src/main.ts` that mounts `App` into `#root`, and the entry
  component is written for spa as well as fullstack. Every one of those files is
  written only when it is absent, and spa adds the component only alongside the
  entry that imports it, so a project keeping its own `src/main.ts` does not
  collect one nothing references.

  The fullstack shell carries the `<!--ssr-head-->` and `<!--ssr-body-->` markers
  the server renderer requires, and no entry script, since the plugin injects
  hydration itself. When a project already has an `index.html` without those
  markers, init names the ones to add rather than editing the file, which is the
  same rule it already followed for an existing bundler config.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 574da4d: New package: the `octane` command line.

  ```bash
  pnpm add -D @octanejs/cli

  octane init          # wire Octane into an existing project
  octane doctor --fix  # find and repair what breaks Octane quietly
  octane mcp add       # register the MCP server with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor
  ```

  Octane is a compiler framework, so its misconfigurations mostly fail _quietly_.
  Two copies of `octane` in one tree break hooks and context without raising
  anything, because hook state is keyed per runtime instance. A missing
  `jsxImportSource` degrades rather than errors. A `declare module '*.tsrx'` shim
  silences resolution instead of fixing it, turning every component import into
  `any`, including your own exports. Running plain `tsc` over `.tsrx` mis-handles
  every file. There are also two distinct integration paths,
  `octane/compiler/vite` and `@octanejs/vite-plugin`, and nothing tells you which
  one you actually wired, or that you wired both.

  `octane doctor` is 20 checks over exactly those failure modes, grouped so the
  cause is reported above its symptoms. `--fix` repairs only the ones whose
  remedy is unambiguous, and edits files as text splices, so the comments and
  formatting in your `tsconfig.json` survive. Everything else prints the exact
  change to make rather than guessing at it. Two checks that need an AST to be
  trustworthy, hooks in a plain JS loop and native `onChange` on text inputs, are
  deliberately absent: the compiler already errors on the first, and a doctor that
  cries wolf gets ignored.

  `octane add react-hook-form` resolves the React package to the binding that
  ports it and prints that binding's supported surface and its known divergences
  from `status.json`. When nothing ports it, it says so instead of installing
  something adjacent. `octane explain` takes the whole minified production error,
  `Minified Octane error #3; visit .../errors/3?args[]=...`, and rebuilds the full
  development message with its arguments substituted back in.

  `octane mcp add` prefers each client's own CLI (`claude mcp add`, `codex mcp
add`) because those tools own their config schema, and falls back to a
  read-merge-backup-write when there is no CLI, as for Cursor and VS Code. A
  config file that is missing, empty, or not valid JSON is treated as empty rather
  than crashed on: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` is commonly present and unparseable. Run
  inside an Octane checkout it also sets `OCTANE_REPO_ROOT`, which is what gates
  the MCP server's maintainer tools.

  Every command is fully drivable by flags and emits one JSON document under
  `--json`, so agents and CI use the same code path a human does. Prompts only
  fill in _missing_ input and only in a real terminal; in a pipe or under `CI` a
  missing answer is a usage error naming the flag that would have supplied it,
  never a hang. Exit codes are fixed: `0` success, `1` failure, `2` usage, `3`
  doctor found error-severity problems.

  Adding a command is one entry in `src/kernel/registry.js` plus one module. The
  entry holds the name and summary so `--help` lists everything without importing
  anything; the module holds the flags and `run`, and help text is derived from
  that spec rather than written by hand. The binding and error-code catalogs ship
  as a snapshot generated from this repository by `pnpm cli:data`, checked in CI,
  because the CLI runs against user projects rather than this checkout.
