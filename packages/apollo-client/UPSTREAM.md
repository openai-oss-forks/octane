- Selected vendored evidence tree: pinned by `audit/upstream.lock.json`, which records each committed `upstream/` file's upstream git blob sha; `pnpm react-port:materialize run --check --package-dir packages/apollo-client` verifies the copy offline against the pinned commit. The upstream MIT license is retained byte-exact as `LICENSE.upstream`, hash-matched to the lock.

The binding reuses Apollo Client's framework-neutral core and mirrors the pinned React adapter layout with Octane hook and component implementations.

ApolloProvider and the SSR prerender wrapper pass the Apollo Context itself to Octane's createElement API. Octane contexts directly provide values and expose no legacy Provider alias; context value merging and child rendering retain the upstream adapter behavior.

## Export crosswalk

The root and `testing` entry points reuse Apollo's framework-neutral exports. The `react`, `react/internal`, `react/ssr`, and `testing/react` entry points expose the complete documented Octane adapter surface recorded in `status.json`; `exports.test.ts` and the executable public type suite guard that surface. React Server Components and the React Compiler runtime entry are explicit gaps because Octane does not consume React's runtime/compiler protocols.

## Test-suite disposition

The tagged repository contains more than forty React hook, context, cache, preloader, SSR, MockedProvider, snapshot, and GraphQL-version-specific runtime artifacts plus repository-wide type integration tests.

Executable paired evidence in this retrofit:

| Upstream artifact | Disposition | Octane location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/react/context/__tests__/ApolloProvider.test.tsx` | adapted one-for-one | `tests/_fixtures/upstream/ApolloProvider.tsrx` |
| `src/react/hooks/__tests__/useApolloClient.test.tsx` | adapted one-for-one | `tests/_fixtures/upstream/useApolloClient.tsrx` |

Remaining upstream React/runtime artifacts stay present in the repository pin but are not yet vendored or adapted; they remain open follow-up before provenance can move to `verified` with pristine runtime/type lanes. Existing Octane client, hydration, SSR, export, and type suites cover the supported surface outside the paired lanes. The bounded differential lane runs the same cache-only `ApolloProvider`/`useQuery` fixture against the pinned React adapter and Octane, avoiding network scheduling as an uncontrolled oracle input.
