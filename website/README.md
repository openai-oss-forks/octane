# Octane website

The official Octane site — an Octane app built on `@octanejs/tanstack-start` and
`@octanejs/tanstack-router` for file routing, SSR, and hydration. The docs content
still uses `@octanejs/mdx` with Shiki highlighting at build time.

## Develop

```bash
pnpm --filter website dev        # streaming dev SSR on http://localhost:5179
pnpm exec vitest run --project website # route and browser smoke tests
```

## Build & preview

```bash
pnpm --filter website build      # TanStack Start + Nitro production build
pnpm --filter website preview    # serves the production build on :3000
pnpm --filter website start      # runs .output/server/index.mjs directly
```

`vite build` produces Nitro's deployable `.output/` directory:

- `.output/public/` — hashed client assets and public files.
- `.output/server/index.mjs` — the production SSR server. Run it with the
  package's `start` script; it honors Nitro's normal host and port variables.

The `preview` script is the local pre-deploy verification step.

## Deploy (Vercel)

Deployment is handled by Nitro's Vercel preset. Vercel selects that preset from
its build environment and the existing [vercel.json](vercel.json) runs the
website build. TanStack Start owns the request handler, route status codes, and
hydration payload; Nitro packages that handler and the client assets for the
target platform. The generated function stays pinned to Node.js 24, matching
the previous adapter.

Dynamic HTML streams from the origin without buffering for compression; the
[Vercel CDN](https://vercel.com/docs/how-vercel-cdn-works/compression) handles
compression. Direct Node deployments serve uncompressed dynamic HTML unless a
streaming-capable proxy provides compression. Static assets remain precompressed.

Project settings in the Vercel dashboard:

| Setting          | Value                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Root Directory   | `website` (enable "Include files outside the Root Directory" — workspace deps) |
| Framework Preset | Other (`vercel.json` supplies the build command) |
| Install Command  | default (`pnpm install` at the repo root)    |
| Node.js Version  | 22.x or 24.x                                |

No environment variables are required.
